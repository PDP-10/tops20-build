
The RDMAIL Program

The RDMAIL program prints messages that have been sent to you by other
users  of  the system through the MAIL program.  Your MAIL.TXT file in
your logged-in directory on PS:  contains these messages.

Note:  If your MAIL.TXT file contains mail sent by Version  4  of  the
MAIL program, you must use Version 4 of RDMAIL to read it.

There are various ways that the system notifies you whenever there  is
mail that you have not read.  If another user sends you mail while you
are not logged in, you receive the following message the next time you
log in:


     @LOGIN (USER) DBELL (PASSWORD) (ACCOUNT) 341<RET>
      Job 35 on TTY42 29-Aug-79 16:14:12
      You have a message
     @


Another user may send you a message while you are logged in.  In  this
case, the system types

     [You have a message from SENDER]

on your terminal.

Messages-of-the-Day sent to you when you are not logged in are printed
on  your  terminal  automatically  after you log in.  However, if your
directory  is  set  to  REPEAT   LOGIN-MESSAGES,   you   receive   all
Messages-of-the-Day  every  time  you log in.  For more information on
the REPEAT LOGIN-MESSAGES subcommand, see the BUILD command help file.
If  a  system  message  is  sent  while  you are logged in and you are
receiving system messages, you are notified immediately:

     [New Message-of-the-Day available]

You can give the SET MAIL-WATCH command to keep informed  of  any  new
mail   you   receive,   especially   if  you  have  given  the  REFUSE
SYSTEM-MESSAGES command.  You can add the SET  MAIL-WATCH  command  to
your COMND.CMD file, if you have one, or type it each time you log in.
When you give this command, it tells the system to notify you when you
have  new  mail.   You  receive this notification only when you are at
TOPS-20 command level.  At intervals of  approximately  five  minutes,
the  TOPS-20  Command  Processor  informs  you  that you have new mail
whenever it prompts you for a new command.  This  message  appears  on
your terminal:

     [You have new mail]

You may give the INFORMATION MAIL command, even if you are not  logged
in,  to  check  on the status of new mail for yourself or other users.
To do this, type the following:

     @INFORMATION (ABOUT) MAIL (FOR USER) name<RET>

The system returns with one of the following responses:

     New mail exists

or

     No new mail exists

or

     Mailbox protected


Running RDMAIL To start RDMAIL, type RDMAIL after the TOPS-20 prompt @
and press the RETURN key.  The program responds with the date and time
prompt as follows:

     @RDMAIL<RET>
     Date and time (/HELP for help)

If you have enabled WHEEL or OPERATOR capabilities, RDMAIL first  asks
you  whether  you  want to read your own mail or that of another user.
For example:

     $RDMAIL<RET>
     Special user (y or n)?

If you type y, you are indicating that you wish to read another user's
mail.   Type  y and press RETURN.  RDMAIL then prompts you to type the
name of the user whose mail you wish to read.  Type the user name  and
press  RETURN.   RDMAIL then prompts you for date and time input.  For
example:

     $RDMAIL<RET>
     Special user (y or n)?  y<RET>
     User name:  DNeff<RET>
     Date and time (/HELP for help)

If you type n, you are indicating that you wish to read your own mail.
Type  n  and  press RETURN.  RDMAIL then prompts you for date and time
input.  For example:

     $RDMAIL<RET>
     Special user (y or n)?  n<RET>
     Date and time (/HELP for help)

RDMAIL allows you to read your messages several ways:

      o  By giving a date and/or time

      o  By giving a program switch or combination of switches

      o  By giving a date  and/or  time  combined  with  one  or  more
         program switches.

To read any new messages, simply press RETURN.

You can define a time period of mail you wish to read.   To  do  this,
type a date and/or a time.  A common TOPS-20 format is:

     MMM DD,YYYY HH:MM:SS

For example, a valid date and time is May 22,1979  17:00:00.   If  you
type  only a date, RDMAIL assumes the time 00:01:00.  If you type only
a time, the program assumes the  present  date.   RDMAIL  responds  by
displaying all messages you received on and after the date and/or time
you typed.

If you type an invalid date or time, you  receive  an  error  message.
Three of the most common ones are:

     ?Invalid date format

or

?Invalid time format

or

?Day of month too large

After the error message RDMAIL returns with the prompt for you to type
a valid date and/or time.

You can use the RDMAIL switches after  the  prompt,  either  alone  or
combined with date/time input.  The RDMAIL switches are:


  Switch        Function


  /ALL                   Types all messages, regardless of date.

  /HELP                  Types the program help text, outlining  the
                         time/date  format  and program switches and
                         their functions.

  /LIST                  Outputs  messages  to  the  line   printer,
                         rather than to your terminal.

  /MESSAGE-OF-THE-DAY    Types    messages    from    the     system
                         Message-of-the-Day  file,  rather than from
                         your own message file.

  /PERUSE                Allows you to peruse  messages,  and  gives
                         only  the  following  information  for each
                         message:
                         Date:  From:  To:  CC:  and Subject.

  /STOP                  Instructs RDMAIL to stop after each message
                         it  types.  At the end of each message, the
                         system prompts you to type RETURN for  more
                         output.  Reading Mail Using RDMAIL Switches

                         You  type   RDMAIL   switches   immediately
                         following  the  prompt,  and may or may not
                         combine them with a date and/or time.   You
                         have  the options of combining switches and
                         preceding each switch with a space.  To use
                         RDMAIL  switches, type a slash (/) followed
                         by the switch name.

/HELP - HELP Switch

     Type /HELP to get information on running RDMAIL.

After the help text prints on your terminal, the system returns with
the  prompt  for  you  to  type date/time information and/or another
switch.

Note:  HELP overrides all other switches that you may  combine  with
it.   The  system  ignores  all  other  specified  switches  in  the
combination, and prints the full RDMAIL help text.


/ALL - ALL Switch

     Type /ALL when you wish to read all messages in the mail  file,
     regardless of date.

     /ALL may be combined with all  other  program  switches  except
     /HELP.

/LIST - LIST Switch

     Type /LIST when you want messages output to  the  line  printer
     rather  than  to  your  terminal.   /LIST  can be combined with
     date/time input, and/or with /ALL.  If you type only /ALL /LIST
     after  the  prompt,  RDMAIL prints all messages in your file on
     the line printer.

/MESSAGE-OF-THE-DAY - System Message Switch

     Type  /MESSAGE-OF-THE-DAY  to  print  mail  from   the   system
     Message-of-the-Day file (PS:<SYSTEM>MAIL.TXT), rather than from
     your  own   message   file.    Since   new   entries   in   the
     Message-of-the-Day file are typed on your terminal when you log
     in, you normally use this switch when a new  Message-of-the-Day
     becomes available while you are logged in.  /MESSAGE-OF-THE-DAY
     may be combined with date/time input.  It may also be  combined
     with all other program switches except /HELP.

     When you type  /MESSAGE-OF-THE-DAY  after  the  prompt,  RDMAIL
     outputs  all  new Messages-of-the-Day since you last logged in,
     whether or not you have read them.

/PERUSE - PERUSE Switch

     Type /PERUSE when you want to peruse  messages  in  your  file.
     Only  the following lines for each message are printed:  Date:,
     From:, To:, CC:, and Subject:  /PERUSE  can  be  combined  with
     date/time input and all other program switches except /HELP.

/STOP - STOP Switch

     Type /STOP to cause RDMAIL to stop after each message  that  it
     types.   Following  each  message,  the  program prompts you to
     press RETURN for more  output.   /STOP  can  be  combined  with
     date/time input and all other program switches except /HELP and
     /LIST.

If you type an invalid switch in RDMAIL, you receive  the  following
message:

     ?Does not match switch or keyword

The system returns with the prompt for you to type a valid switch.


RDMAIL Messages

Fatal errors are preceded by a question mark (?).  A warning message
is preceded by a percent sign (%).
