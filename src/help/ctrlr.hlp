
CTRL/R

Reprints the current command line, incorporating the corrections  made
with  the  DELETE  key  or  CTRL/W.   Use  on hard-copy terminals when
backslashes and underscores caused by editing with DELETE  and  CTRL/W
make  the command line difficult to read.  Use on video terminals when
a system message covers the command line.
