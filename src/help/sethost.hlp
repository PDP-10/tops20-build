
SET HOST command

The SET HOST command connects your terminal to another system.


Format 1

@SET HOST node-name::  /switch


Format 2

(Omitting the node name on the command line allows you  to  define  an
interrupt sequence)

@SET HOST /switch
Two character interrupt sequence (^\,<RET>): interrupt-sequence
Node name: node-name::

     where:

     node-name::         is the name of the remote host that you  want
                         to connect your terminal to.  Two colons (::)
                         following the node name are optional.

     /switch             is  an  optional  keyword  that  selects  the
                         service  used  to  connect your terminal to a
                         remote node.
                              Default - /CTERM

     interrupt-sequence  is the characters that switch control of  the
                         terminal  back  to  the  local host.  You are
                         prompted for an interrupt  sequence  only  if
                         you give the /CTERM switch.
                              Default - CTRL\,<RET>

                                 NOTE

        This command description assumes you are connecting to
        another  TOPS-20 system.  For information on accessing
        other operating systems, see  the  DIGITAL  Networking
        Pocket  Guide.   This command description also assumes
        that you are establishing a connection with the  CTERM
        program.


                      SET HOST Command Switches

     /CTERM         connects your  terminal  to  the  remote  node  by
                    running  the  CTERM  communications program.  Both
                    processors must be running DECnet Phase 4 software
                    (available  under  a  separate  license).  The SET
                    HOST command runs the CTERM communications program
                    by  default.   If the remote node does not support
                    the  CTERM  protocol,  SET   HOST   attempts   the
                    connection  again.  In the second attempt however,
                    SET HOST runs the communications  program  defined
                    by   the   logical   name   NRT: (Network   Remote
                    Terminal).
                         Default

     /NRT           runs the communications service program defined by
                    the  logical  name NRT: (Network Remote Terminal).
                    NRT: can be a system or job  logical  name.   When
                    both exist, the job definition takes precedence.


Characteristics

     Logging into the Remote Node

          Once your terminal is connected  to  the  remote  node,  the
          system  responds  by identifying itself and prompting you to
          log in.  You can then log in to the system.

     Path of Terminal Input and Output

          The SET HOST command passes terminal input through the local
          host to the remote host.  Output from the remote host passes
          through the local host to your terminal.

     Making a Series of Host Connections

          Once you have logged in to a remote node, you can give  EXEC
          commands  and  run  programs just as you would on your local
          node.  You can then establish a connection to another remote
          node.   For  example,  if your local host is AURORA, you can
          give the command SET HOST BOSTON  to  connect  to  the  node
          BOSTON;  after logging in to BOSTON, you can use the command
          SET HOST DENVER to connect to node DENVER.

     Returning to Your Local Host

          To return  your  terminal  to  your  local  host,  type  the
          interrupt  sequence  to  temporarily break the connection to
          the remote host.  Note that the  connection  to  the  remote
          host  remains intact until you reset the CTERM program.  You
          can reconnect your terminal to the remote host by giving the
          CONTINUE command.

          When you log out of  the  remote  host,  the  connection  is
          broken and you are returned to your local host.

          If  you  have  established  a  series  of  connections,  the
          interrupt  character  defined in your first SET HOST command
          returns you to your local host.   For  example,  your  local
          host  is  AURORA  and you SET HOST to BOSTON, specifying the
          CTRL\<RET> interrupt sequence to  return  to  AURORA.   Then
          from  BOSTON  you  connect to DENVER.  Typing the CTRL\<RET>
          interrupt to DENVER returns you to AURORA, not BOSTON.

     Specifying the Interrupt Sequence

           o  The interrupt sequence  can  be  a  combination  of  two
              characters  or control characters.  For example, KL ^KL,
              K^L, and ^K^L are valid interrupt sequences.

           o  If you specify only one interrupt character, the  second
              character  is ^J.  For example if you specify only ^N as
              the interrupt sequence, the actual interrupt sequence is
              ^N^J.   If  you  type  only F, the interrupt sequence is
              F^J.

           o  Each  interrupt  character  must  be   different.    For
              example, ^K^K is invalid, while ^KK is a valid interrupt
              sequence.

           o  Do not  type  a  comma  or  a  space  between  interrupt
              characters  as  it  will  be  interpreted  as the second
              character in the sequence.

           o  The RETURN key can only be used in the default interrupt
              sequence, ^\<RET>.

           o  The interrupt sequence cannot contain predefined TOPS-20
              control  characters.   For  example,  if  you attempt to
              specify an interrupt sequence as ^T^I, the ^T will print
              the  run  status  and  the ^I will print a tab.  See the
              help files for the control characters.

     Controlling Scrolling on a Remote Host

          On your local host, <CTRL/S> and <CTRL/Q>  are  the  default
          control   characters  that  pause  and  continue  scrolling.
          Typing <CTRL/Q> continues scrolling whether scrolling paused
          because  you  typed  <CTRL/S>  or  the  output  paused on an
          end-of-page.

          However, CTERM does not pass these characters to the  remote
          host.   When  using  <CTRL/S>  and <CTRL/Q>, it is the local
          host that actually controls scrolling.  Therefore if  output
          from  the remote host has paused on an end-of-page, <CTRL/Q>
          will not  continue  scrolling.   Other  pause  and  continue
          characters  are  passed  to  the  remote  host.  You can use
          <CTRL/A> to both pause and resume scrolling or you  can  use
          the  TERMINAL  PAUSE command to assign any two characters of
          your choosing to control scrolling.  For consistency, it  is
          recommended  that  you  define  the  same pause and continue
          characters on your local and remote node.


Hints

     Listing Available Nodes

          Use the INFORMATION DECNET command to display the  names  of
          DECnet nodes accessible to your node.


Effect on Terminal

     The SET HOST command connects your terminal to the remote system.
     After  the remote system's herald message is printed, you can log
     in.

     2.  Give the INFORMATION DECNET  command  to  find  out  if  node
         BOSTON  is  reachable from your host node.  Then give the SET
         HOST command without typing the  node  name  on  the  command
         line.  Omitting the node name causes the system to prompt you
         for an interrupt sequence.  After typing your  own  interrupt
         sequence,  the  system prompts you for the name of the remote
         node.
