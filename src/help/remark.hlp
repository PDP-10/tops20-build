
REMARK command

The REMARK command tells the system to regard the terminal input  that
follows as comment only.


Format

     @REMARK (MODE)
     Type remark.  End with CTRL/Z.


Characteristics

     Ending Remarks

          Until you give a CTRL/Z, the system merely displays what you
          type, instead of trying to interpret it as commands.


Hints

     Useful During TALK or ADVISE Session

          If you have already established contact with another user by
          a  TALK or ADVISE command before giving REMARK, his terminal
          will also display what you type.  Give  the  REMARK  command
          before  sending  lengthy  comments or demonstrating commands
          that you don't want to take effect.
