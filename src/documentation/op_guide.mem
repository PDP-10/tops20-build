   This guide gives  you,  the  operator,  an  overview  of  the  TOPS-20
   operating system and serves as a task-oriented reference for operating
   the various hardware components that  support  the  TOPS-20  software.
   The  following  paragraphs  give  a  brief  description of the type of
   information contained in each chapter.

        Chapter  1  provides  a  brief  description  of  the   operator's
        responsibilities and the documentation supplied either by DIGITAL
        or by personnel at your installation.

        Chapter 2 describes the various  CPUs,  memory  types,  front-end
        responsibilities,  and  the  peripherals  that are handled by the
        front-end processor.

        Chapter  3  briefly  describes   the   major   TOPS-20   software
        components.

        Chapter 4 describes the  various  ways  of  loading  the  system,
        loading  the  monitor  using  the various media, and readying the
        system for timesharing.

        Chapter 5 introduces the  operator  interface  command  language,
        OPR.

        Chapter 6 describes all software tasks for the  TOPS-20  (GALAXY)
        batch system.

        Chapter 7 describes those tasks that are  generally  done  on  an
        infrequent  schedule and those tasks that are performed only when
        requested.

        Chapter 8 describes the tasks that  are  usually  included  in  a
        daily schedule.

        Chapter 9 describes the error recovery procedures.

   Although various installations may run their systems differently, this
   guide  describes  a  general set of procedures for running the TOPS-20
   software on the various hardware systems.   Each  installation  should
   tailor  these  procedures  to  suit  its  needs and add procedures for
   specific applications.

   This guide assumes that  you  have  read,  understood,  and  used  the
   _______  ______  _____   TOPS-20  User's  Guide.   In  some  cases this guide refers to another
   manual for additional  information,  or  your  installation  may  have
   purchased  some software in addition to the standard TOPS-20 software.
   For example, this manual does not include the operating procedures for
   ARPANET and DECnet.  Therefore, you should have the latest editions of

                      RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OPERATOR                      RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OPERATOR



   As the TOPS-20 operator, you are responsible for  keeping  the  system
   running  and providing the user with the best possible service.  To do
   this, you must be aware of all the system resources available to  you,
   know  how  to  interact with the system and with users, and be able to
   recognize and solve problems before they become serious.

   Your first task in starting the system is to load  the  front-end  and
   main  processor  monitors.   After that, the system starts a series of
   programs to support batch and timesharing users.  Once the  system  is
   started,  you must check the status of jobs, respond to user requests,
   and perform routine tasks such as replenishing the paper supply for  a
   line printer or cleaning magnetic tape drives.

   Because the system is complex, sometimes a monitor ceases to  function
   and   crashes.   A  crash  may  result  from  software  (programming),
   hardware, or environmental problems.  When a crash  occurs,  you  must
   recognize  the  symptoms, take the appropriate corrective steps to get
   the system  back  up  as  quickly  as  possible,  and  save  important
   information about the crash.



   1.1  DOCUMENTATION   1.1  DOCUMENTATION

   To keep informed of your responsibilities and to perform the necessary
   operator  tasks,  you should read and have available for reference all
   documentation relevant to an operator.  Documentation is  supplied  by
   DIGITAL,  your  installation,  and  other  operators.   The next three
   sections describe the documentation available from these sources.

   DIGITAL also supplies some text files on the magnetic tapes  used  for
   software  distribution.   These  files can be identified by their file
   types:  .HLP, .MEM, .BWR, or .DOC.  These files are usually in a  disk
   directory  from which you can have them printed or have them typed out
   on a hard-copy terminal.

   Your installation personnel may add some text files to the system that
   can be printed or typed.

   You should also have a list  of  specific  duties  for  each  operator
   shift.   This  list  should  be  written  by  the  system  manager and
   operations staff, using this manual as  a  guide.   Your  installation
   personnel  can  also  tailor this manual to their needs.  For example,
   installation-specific instructions,  such  as  locking  computer  room
   doors, finding paper, and running application programs, can be added.

   Your system manager should give  you  an  operator's  notebook  and  a
   system  logbook  that  contain  pages you must fill out to record what
   happens systemwide.

   The operator's notebook is used to record shift-to-shift communication
   among operators, and between operators and the system manager.  Always
   read it before you begin your shift.  Notebook entries  might  include
   scheduled  system  downtime,  new software to install or try, problems
   met on preceding shifts, and specific instructions not in  the  normal
   schedule.

   The system logbook is used to note important events  relative  to  the
   system  availability.   The  entries  should  include system downtime,
   hardware problems, and system shutdown time.  To  identify  the  items
   easily,  separate  hardware  and  software  entries,  perhaps  listing
   hardware entries on left-hand pages and software entries on right-hand
   pages.  Check this log when you start work; be sure to keep it current
   throughout your shift.

   You should also save the output from the  CTY.   Your  system  manager
   should  determine how long to keep it and where to file it.  It can be
   a useful reference when there are system problems.

   Software tasks include loading and starting  the  system,  interacting
   with  users,  and  performing  error  recovery  procedures.  Chapter 4
   describes loading and starting  the  system,  Chapters  6,  7,  and  8
   describe the batch tasks and scheduled and unscheduled software tasks,
   and Chapter 9 describes the error recovery procedures.



   1.3  UNPRIVILEGED OPERATOR TASKS   1.3  UNPRIVILEGED OPERATOR TASKS

   Your system manager may have granted the  SEMI-OPERATOR  privilege  to
   some  users.   When  enabled,  this  privilege limits operator-related
   activity  to  accessing  system  status  information  and  controlling
   certain devices specified at installation for semi-operator access.

   The SEMI-OPERATOR privilege provides unprivileged users with  valuable
   information  and  device control that was available only to privileged
   operators in older versions of TOPS-20.

   You can enable and disable the SEMI-OPERATOR privilege systemwide,  as
   described in Section 5.6.

   In addition to the configurations listed above for  the  2060  system,
   the Common File System (CFS-20) configuration requires the following:

         o  2 to 4 2060 systems

         o  1-4Mw Memory per system

         o  1 CI20 per system

         o  1 Star Coupler

                                    NOTE

           Each CFS-20 system requires an RP04 or RP06 disk drive
           for  the  front end file system.  The system structure
           can reside on this disk or on another RP04,  RP06,  or
           RP07  disk;  or be a supported multi-disk RP04 or RP06
           structure.  The system structure cannot reside  on  an
           RP20  disk  or  on  a  disk  controlled  by  an HSC-50
           controller.



   2.2  CENTRAL PROCESSORS   2.2  CENTRAL PROCESSORS

   The KL10 central processor, which  directs  the  entire  operation  of
   2040S and 2060 systems, contains:

        1.  A microcoded instruction set (383 instructions)

        2.  Fast integrated-circuit general-purpose registers

        3.  Interrupt and trap facilities

   The  central  processor,  memory,  and  mass-storage  controllers  are
   contained in two cabinets.





                                    2-3

   2.3  MEMORY   2.3  MEMORY

   There are four types of memory storage units  available  for  the  -20
   series  hardware:   MA20  or  MB20  internal  memory, and MF20 or MG10
   memory.

   The size of memory storage ranges from 768K to 4  megawords  (K=1024).
   Internal  memory  can  be  1-,  2-,  or 4-way interleaved.  You cannot
   specify  interleaving  for  MOS  memory;  however,  it  is  implicitly
   interleaved.  Each word of memory has 36 bits of data.



   2.4  DATA CHANNELS AND CONTROLLERS   2.4  DATA CHANNELS AND CONTROLLERS

   The data channels and controllers provide the interface  between  mass
   storage  devices  (disk  and  magnetic  tape)  and  main  memory.  The
   controllers are units that control the operation of one or  more  disk
   drives   or  tape  drives.   The  channels  in  conjunction  with  the
   controllers transfer information to memory at the request of the  CPU.
   The  channel  that interfaces the DECSYSTEM-20 memory to massbus disks
   and tapes is the RH20.  The channel that interfaces  the  DECSYSTEM-20
   memory  to  the  CI  is  the  CI20.   In  a CFS configuration, another
   DECSYSTEM-20 can be connected to the same CI by means of its own CI20.

   A DX20 tape controller  with  the  TX02  controller  and  channel  can
   support  a  maximum  of  eight  TU70, 71, or 72 tape drives.  With the
   TX03/TX05 tape switch options, a system can address and use up  to  16
   tape  drives  on  a  single controller by switching the access of tape
   drives from one controller to another.

   A DX20 disk controller can support up to eight RP20 disks.  Each  RP20
   disk  unit  has  two spindles.  An HSC50 disk controller can support a
   maximum of 24 RA60 or RA81 disk drives.



   2.5  CONSOLE FRONT-END PROCESSOR (2040S, 2060)   2.5  CONSOLE FRONT-END PROCESSOR (2040S, 2060)

   The console front-end processor is a PDP-11 computer and  is  included
   in 2040S and 2060 systems.  The console front-end handles:

        1.  Line printers

        2.  Card reader

        3.  Floppy disks

        4.  Terminals

        5.  Console functions

        6.  Microcode loading

        7.  Memory configuration

        8.  System startup

        9.  Diagnostics

   The console front-end processor is in the cabinet to the left  of  the
   two  cabinets  containing  the central processor, internal memory, and
   mass-storage   controllers.    The   console    front-end    processor
   communicates  with  the central processor through the DTE20 interface.
   The front-end memory consists of 28K of 18-bit words (16 data bits and
   2 parity bits).  The floppy disks are used for initial system loading.



   2.6  FLOPPY DISKS   2.6  FLOPPY DISKS

   Three floppy disks are  distributed  with  each  new  version  of  the
   TOPS-20  front-end  software.   They  are  small,  about  the size and
   appearance of a 45 rpm record, very flexible, magnetic-storage  media.
   Their  main  functions include loading and starting the PDP-11 and the
   KL10.  They are also used to  run  diagnostics  that  pertain  to  the
   front-end processor.



   2.7  PERIPHERALS   2.7  PERIPHERALS

   On the 2040S and 2060 systems, the UNIBUS (unipath  bus)  handles  all
   the  communication  lines  between the front-end processor and all the
   devices that are attached to the front-end.

   The standard -20 series hardware peripherals are described below.



   2.7.1  Line Printers   2.7.1  Line Printers

   A maximum of two physical line printers is allowed on 2040S  and  2060
   systems.

   96-character  print set have uppercase and lowercase characters.  Each
   printer has a Vertical Format  Unit,  or  VFU,  which  consists  of  a
   carriage  control  tape  depending  on  the model.  The VFU is used to
   control paper motion in the printer.   The  preceding  information  is
   summarized in Table 2-2 below.

   2.7.3  Disk Packs   2.7.3  Disk Packs

   Disk storage allows rapid transfer of data in and out of main  memory.
   The 2040S and 2060 systems require at least one disk be dual-ported so
   that the front-end computer and the central processor can both  access
   the data on the disk.

   The disk packs that the 2040S and 2060 systems support are:

        1.  The RP04 removable disk pack, which  has  a  20-million  word
            (36-bit word) capacity

        2.  The RP06 removable disk pack, which  has  a  40-million  word
            (36-bit word) capacity

        3.  The RP07 non-removable disk pack, which  has  a  112  million
            word (36-bit word) capacity.

        4.  The RP20 non-removable disk pack, which  has  a  120  million
            word (36-bit word) capacity.

   In addition, the 2060 systems support the following:

        1.  The RA60 removable disk pack, which  has  a  46-million  word
            (36-bit word) capacity.

        2.  The RA81 non-removable disk pack, which  has  a  102  million
            word (36-bit word) capacity.

   The drives for these packs  provide  error  detection  and  correction
   hardware as well as high-speed access and transfer rates.

   On the 2040S and 2060 systems, the disk drives have an RH20 integrated
   controller  and  data channel for access by the central processor.  If
   the drive has the dual-port option, the  console  front-end  processor
   accesses a disk drive through an RH11 disk controller.  In addition to
   the  massbus  devices  that  are  handled  by  the   RH20   integrated
   controller,  the  2060 system can have the HSC50 controller for access
   by the central processor.

   2.7.5  Terminals   2.7.5  Terminals

   You (the operator) and each timesharing user interacts with the system
   through  a  terminal.   Generally,  you use a hard-copy terminal:  for
   example, an LA36, to start, stop, load, and continue  the  system  and
   user  programs.   Using  a  hard-copy  terminal allows you to save the
   printed output of all interactions with users and  the  system.   This
   output  is  especially  useful if you have a problem with your system.
   Users interact with the  system  with  either  a  hard-copy  or  video
   terminal.

   3.1  OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER MAJOR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS   3.1  OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER MAJOR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

   The operating system for the -20 series hardware  is  called  TOPS-20.
   If  the  2040S  and 2060 is on the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects
   Agency Network), the  operating  system  is  called  TOPS-20AN.   Both
   operating systems support concurrent timesharing and batch processing.

   The TOPS-20 command language or command processor is also  called  the
   EXEC.

   On the 2040S and 2060 systems, the RSX-20F console front-end operating
   system  aids  the central processor and TOPS-20 by doing such tasks as
   handling  the  console,  terminal  communications,  peripherals,   and
   diagnostics.



   3.2  LANGUAGES   3.2  LANGUAGES

   The following languages are available with TOPS-20:

   Before you start the system, you should become  familiar  with  a  few
   switches and lights on the processor.

   The four load switches and two power  switches  are  on  the  leftmost
   cabinet,  to the right of the DECSYSTEM-20 label.  Just above them are
   the fault and power lights.  The switch register is located behind the
   door below the load and power switches.

   The purposes of the four white load switches are from left to right:

        LOAD SWITCH                   PURPOSE

        1.            Loads the system according to the contents  of  the
                      switch register (Section 4.2.3).

        2.            Loads the system from a disk pack (Section 4.2.1).

        3.            Loads the system from floppy disks (Section 4.2.2).

        4.            Enables loading when pushed simultaneously with  SW
                      REG, DISK, or FLOPPY switches.

|  The black power switch, labeled SYSTEM ON  and  SYSTEM  OFF,  normally
|  supplies  power  to  the system.  The red SYSTEM LOCK switch should be
   used only in emergencies, such as in a fire, when you  must  turn  off
   the power as quickly as possible.

                                  CAUTION

|          After you press the SYSTEM LOCK switch, you must  call
           your  DIGITAL  Field Service Representative to restore
           power.

   The switch register contains 18 switches (or bits) which are  used  to
   set certain values when you load via the switch register.

   When the power light is red, it indicates that power  is  on.   If  it
   blinks,  a  DIGITAL  Field  Service  Representative  at  your site has
   previously set OVERRIDE.  You should not run the system with  OVERRIDE
   set,  unless  instructed  to  do  so  by  your  DIGITAL  Field Service
   Representative,  because  the  system  does  not  power  down  if   it
   overheats.

   The fault light should normally be off.   If  it  glows,  notify  your
   DIGITAL Field Service Representative.  A glowing fault light indicates
   a malfunction, such as overheating, which stops the system.

   In most cases you should only have to check  to  see  that  the  power
|  light  over  the black SYSTEM ON/SYSTEM OFF switch is glowing red.  If
|  the light is not glowing red,  place  the  switch  in  the  SYSTEM  ON
   position.

   Be sure that the system is completely powered on:

        1.  Check the disk drives.  If power  is  off,  remove  the  back
            cover and make sure that the breakers labeled CB1 and CB2 are
                                                                   ______            both on.  For HSC-50 disk subsystems,  refer  to  the  HSC-50
            ______ _____            User's Guide.

        2.  Check the magnetic tape drives.  If power is off,  press  the
            rocker  switch,  that  is,  the  white  switch containing the
            ON/OFF light on the front panel.  If power is still off, open
            the front cabinet and reset the breaker.

        3.  Check the line printers.  If power is  off  on  an  LP20A  or
            LP20B printer (which has four buttons on the right of the top
            panel), reset the knee-level breaker on the lower panel.  The
            TAPE light will be on.  This means you must reload the Direct
            Access Vertical Format Unit (VFU) when the line printer is up
            and  running.   If  you have an LP20F or LP20H printer (which
            has four rocker switches on the left of the top panel),  lift
            the  cover  just  above the lights and reset the breaker.  Be
            sure that the printer has paper.

        4.  Turn on the console terminal.  Be sure that it is on-line and
            has paper.

   4.2  LOADING THE SYSTEM   4.2  LOADING THE SYSTEM

   After powering up the system or deciding you  must  reload,  you  have
   some  system  loading  alternatives.  You can load from a disk pack or
   floppy disks, and you can specify nondefault parameters via the switch
   register.   In most cases, you should load from a disk pack.  However,
   if you do not have a disk drive available on  the  RH20,  or  if  your
   system  manager wants you to use software from a floppy disk, load the
   system using floppy disks.  If you use the switch  register  to  load,
   you also enter the KL initialization operator dialog (KLINIT).  KLINIT
   lets you take nondefault loading paths; that is, you can load  from  a
   unit  other  than  disk  drive  0,  configure  memory yourself, load a
   bootstrap from any file, or specify a monitor other than  the  default
   monitor.

                                    NOTE

           The following examples use the name BS: for  the  name
           of  the  system  structure.   The  name of your system
           structure would appear in the place of BS.

   4.2.1  Loading from Disk Pack   4.2.1  Loading from Disk Pack

   Loading from disk pack is the most common way to load the system.   Be
   sure that system power is ON, that all hardware and software have been
   correctly installed,  and  that  the  disk  packs  have  been  mounted
   properly.   Also,  be  sure  the  formatted  disk  pack containing the
   RSX-20F files is on a  dual-ported  drive  (CONTROLLER  SELECT  switch
   points to A/B), and the drive is unit 0 on the RH11.

   Next, do the following:

        1.  Press the DISK and ENABLE load switches simultaneously.

        2.  Type the current date and time and confirm it.

        3.  Type the reason for reloading.

        4.  Type YES or NO response to the RUN CHECKD question.

   These steps load the front-end software, load the TOPS-20 monitor, and
   start the system for timesharing.

   Now, a more detailed explanation of the above steps:

        1.  Press the upper halves of the DISK and ENABLE  load  switches
            simultaneously.   The following is an example of what is then
            printed on the CTY:

            that the BOOT program is running, and the line following this
            output  tells  you  what the BOOT program is doing.  The line
            [BS MOUNTED] is output by the TOPS-20 monitor and means  that
            the  system structure has been mounted and the line following
            this output  tells  you  what  the  BOOT  program  is  doing.
            TOPS-20  then  outputs  the  next  line  to  all terminals to
            indicate the system is being restarted  and  is  soon  to  be

   4.2.2  Loading from Floppy Disks   4.2.2  Loading from Floppy Disks

   Load from floppy disks if problems prevent you  from  loading  from  a
   disk  pack, or if you need a version of the front-end software that is
   only on floppy disks.  Be sure that system power is ON and the  proper
   software  exists  on the disk packs and the floppy disks (as on System
   Floppy A and System Floppy B).  Mount the floppy containing  the  BOOT
   program  (System  Floppy  A)  on  unit 0, the left unit.  Mount System
   Floppy B on unit 1, the right unit.  Leave the  floppy  disks  mounted
   while the system is running.

   Next, do the following:

        1.  Press the FLOPPY and ENABLE load switches simultaneously.

            you what the BOOT program is doing.  The line [BS MOUNTED] is
            output  by TOPS-20  and means  that the  system structure has

   4.2.3  Loading Via the Switch Register   4.2.3  Loading Via the Switch Register

   Load the system using the switch register if you have to do any of the
   following:

        1.  Configure cache or memory yourself, because  you  cannot  use
            the default configuration.

        2.  Load a  bootstrap  with  a  name  other  than  BOOT.EXB,  for
            example,  MTBOOT.EXB,  which  loads  a  monitor from magnetic
            tape.

        3.  Load a TOPS-20 monitor other than BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE,  for
            example,  a  monitor  on  magnetic  tape  or a monitor with a
            different name on disk.

        4.  Load from a disk pack that is not on unit 0.

        5.  Dump the TOPS-20 monitor after a crash.

   To begin the loading procedure you must use a disk pack or floppy disk
   to  load  the  software  for the front end.  If you are going to use a
   disk pack, it must contain the appropriate software and be mounted  on
   a  dual-ported drive (CONTROLLER SELECT switch is set to A/B).  If you
   are going to use floppy disks, you must have  the  appropriate  floppy
   disks mounted (System Floppy A and System Floppy B).

   Next, do the following:

        1.  Set the proper switches (or bits)  in  the  switch  register.
            Usually,  you  want  to set switches 0, 1, and 2 to enter the
            KLINIT dialog.  If you are going to use a disk pack on unit 0
            to get the front-end software, also set switch 7.

        2.  Press the load switches SW REG and ENABLE simultaneously.

        3.  Answer the questions to the KLINIT dialog (Section 9.6).

        4.  Type the current date and time and confirm it.

        5.  Type the reason for reloading.

        6.  Type a YES or NO response to the RUN CHECKD question.

   These steps load the front-end software, load the TOPS-20 monitor, and
   start the system for timesharing.

   Now, a more detailed explanation of the above steps:

        1.  Set the appropriate switches (or bits) in the switch register
            by raising them.  The bits and the meaning for those used are
            listed in Table 4-1.

     0            If this is set, the remaining bits  are  interpreted.
                  You must set this to load via the switch register.

     1,2          If both  are  set,  the  KL  initialization  operator
                  dialog (KLINIT) is loaded and started.

                  If either one is set,  only  the  front-end  monitor,
                  RSX-20F,   is  started;  there  is  no  communication
                  between the KL and console front-end processors.

                  If neither is set, the system is loaded in  the  same
                  way  as  by the DISK or FLOPPY load switch.  However,
                  because other bits are interpreted, you  can  specify
                  the unit number of the bootstrap device in bits 8-10.
                  The  default  path  is  taken  by  KLINIT  until  the
                  bootstrap prompts with BOOT>.  Then you can specify a
                  monitor   other   than   the   default   (which    is
                  BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE)   or   give   a   switch,  for
                  example, /D to dump KL memory.

|    3-6          These bits are used to set the speed of the DH11 that
|                 is used as the CTY (see bits 11-14).  If any of these
|                 are set, bits 8-10 are read as the DH11 unit  number,
|                 and  bits  11-14  are  read as the number of the DH11
|                 line that is to be the CTY.  If none  are  set,  bits
|                 8-10  are  read  as  the unit number of the disk from
|                 which to boot.  If you want to redirect the CTY  line
|                 using  the  switch register, you can boot only from a
|                 unit 0 disk.

     7            If this is set, the bootstrap device is a  disk  pack
                  on  an  RP04  or RP06 disk drive attached to the RH11
                  disk channel.  Front-end files on  a  disk  pack  are
                  used for system loading.

                  If this is not set, the  bootstrap  devices  are  the
                  floppy  disks.   Front-end  files on floppy disks are
                  used for system loading.

     8-10         These three bits allow you to specify in  binary  the
                  unit  number  of  the bootstrap device (0 to 7).  For
                  example, no bits set  indicate  unit  0;  bit  8  set
                  indicates  unit 1, bit 9 set indicates unit 2, bits 8
                  and 9 set indicate unit 3, bit 10 indicates  unit  4,
                  bits  10 and 8 set indicate unit 5, and bits 10 and 9
                  set indicate unit 6.
|  
|    11-14        These bits are used to select the  DH11  line  number
|                 within  the  selected DH11 unit that will be the CTY.
|                 They are valid only if bits 3-6 are set.

     15           This bit indicates what is done  when  an  I/O  error
                  occurs  during  bootstrapping.  When this bit is set,
                  the operation is retried  indefinitely  if  an  error
                  occurs.   If  this bit is not set (the normal case) a
                  halt occurs after ten unsuccessful retries.

     16-17        Currently not used and must not be set.

        2.  Press the upper halves of the SW REG and ENABLE load switches
            simultaneously.

            The following is an example of what is  printed  on  the  CTY
            when  bits 0, 1, and 2 are set, that is, when 7 is entered in
            the switch register.

            The first line of output tells you the version  and  creation
            time  and  date  of  RSX-20F.   The  next line indicates that
            DX0: (the floppy disk on unit 0) is the system device  (SY0:)
            for  the  front-end  tasks.  The next two lines tell you that
            floppy units 0 and 1 have been mounted.  If bit  7  had  been
            set,  the  system  would have gone to disk drive 0 for a disk
            pack and the line with DX1 would have been omitted.   If  any
            of  bits  8-10  had been set, the unit number would have been
            something other than 0.

            The lines beginning with KLI are printed by  KLINIT,  the  KL
            initialization operator dialog.

            All lines beginning with KLI and all text between those lines

            default path up to and including the loading and starting  of
            the  KL  bootstrap.   Then,  instead  of  loading the default
            monitor, BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE, the  bootstrap  prompts  with

            want to load.  For example:

                 BOOT><SUBSYS>TEST01.EXE

            If you press RETURN after BOOT>, you get the default monitor.

            Once you specify the monitor, it is loaded and  started;  the

            If you have a DX20 magnetic  tape  system,  you  also  see  a

            If "?" precedes CHN, see Section 9.4.5.

            Because the bit settings in the latter example cause much  of
            the dialog to take a default path, continue reading at Step 4
            for that example.  For the former example, continue  at  Step
            3.

            you are in the KL initialization operator dialog, KLINIT, and
            you must answer the questions asked.

            Once the KL bootstrap has been loaded and started via KLINIT,
            and  you have responded successfully to the BOOT> prompt, the
            TOPS-20 monitor prints:

   4.3  LOADING THE TOPS-20 MONITOR   4.3  LOADING THE TOPS-20 MONITOR

   The TOPS-20 monitor is loaded during the  procedure  for  loading  the
   system,  which was discussed in the previous three sections.  The next
   two sections  give  additional  information  on  loading  the  TOPS-20
   monitor to emphasize where the monitor can be loaded from.



   4.3.1  Loading TOPS-20 from a Disk Pack with BOOT   4.3.1  Loading TOPS-20 from a Disk Pack with BOOT

   When you load the system using the DISK or FLOPPY load switch, TOPS-20
   is loaded and started from BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE.

   When you load the  system  via  the  switch  register,  the  bootstrap
   program  issues  a  prompt  and  you  can  either press RETURN for the
   default monitor (BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE) or type a  file  specification
   for   a   different  monitor.   If  you  omit  a  field  in  the  file
   specification, that field is defaulted to what it is  in  the  default
   monitor.

                            ----- Example -----

             _______________________        BOOT><TESTSY>MON002.EXE<RET>

   If you set bits 1 and 2 in the switch register and receive the  KLINIT
   question:

        KLI -- LOAD KL BOOTSTRAP [YES,NO,FILENAME]?

   you  can  specify  a  bootstrap  other  than  the  default,  BOOT.EXB.
   However, the file you specify must reside on the bootstrap device.

   In this example the KL bootstrap is VBORP4.EXB and the TOPS-20 monitor
   is BS:<SYSTEM>MON002.EXE.

        KLI -- LOAD KL BOOTSTRAP [YES,NO,FILENAME]?

                              ----- Hint -----

   Entering the KLINIT dialog to get the question LOAD KL BOOTSTRAP or to
   get  the  BOOT> prompt is useful for testing new bootstrap programs or
   new TOPS-20 monitors.

   If you need to load a TOPS-20  monitor  from  magnetic  tape,  do  the
   following:

        1.  Mount  the  magnetic  tape  containing  the  monitor  on  any
            available tape drive.

        2.  Load the system via the switch register with bits 0, 1, and 2
            set.

        3.  Enter the KLINIT dialog.

        4.  After LOAD KL BOOTSTRAP, type MTBOOT.

        5.  After MTBOOT>, type MT:  and press RETURN to load  and  start
            the monitor on the magnetic tape.

                            ----- Example -----

           You can use spaces instead  of  hyphens.   Other  date
           formats are accepted but they are not recommended.

   The system then prints a line telling you the day, date, and time  you

                At this time the system may automatically run the
                CHECKD   program   if   certain   problems   were
                previously  found;   otherwise,   it   asks   the
                following question.

   Question:  RUN CHECKD?

   Reply:     You must answer Y for YES or N for NO.  If you have a daily
              scheduled  reload  or  experienced  a hardware failure, you
              should answer Y.  Otherwise, you should normally answer N.

   If  the  question  isn't  answered  within  one  minute,  the   system
   redisplays the question and supplies a default answer:  "NO".

   If you answer Y, CHECKD performs a bit-table and consistency check for
   the  system  structure.   It then lists any problems it found with bad
   pages or files.  Next it prints a  summary  of  page  counts  and  the
   number  of  lost  pages.   Any  lost  pages  are allocated to the file
   BS:<OPERATOR>BS-LOST-PAGES.BIN.n (where "n" is the  generation  number
   of the file).

   Depending on the size of the structure and  the  number  of  files  it
   contains,  CHECKD  can take between five and thirty minutes to perform
   its checking.  When the CHECKD program starts, it prints:

        [CHECKING FILE CONSISTENCY]

        [WORKING ON STRUCTURE - BS:]

                                    NOTE

           If CHECKD lists any problems  before  the  summary  of
           page  counts, or if it says there are lost pages after
           the summary, refer to Section 9.7.1 to determine  what
           action to take.

                actual name of the system structure.

   After CHECKD has finished running, it prints the following message:

        RUNNING DDMP

   DDMP is a TOPS-20 background  job  that  moves  pages  from  the  disk
   swapping  area  to  the  disk  file  area.   After the DDMP program is
   finished, the monitor starts the SYSJOB program and prints  a  message
   similar to the following:

        SYSJOB 7(78) STARTED AT 5-MAR-88 11:00

   The SYSJOB program reads the file PS:<SYSTEM>n-SYSJOB.RUN.  This  file
   contains  commands  that  start  various  system  programs.   The last
   command in the n-SYSJOB.RUN  file  is  GET  SYSTEM:n-PTYCON.ATO.   The
                                                                  _______   PTYCON.ATO file starts various jobs as subjobs.  (Refer to the TOPS-20
   __________ _______ ________ _________ ______   Operator's Command Language Reference Manual for more  information  on
   the PTYCON program.)

   Once the PTYCON.ATO  file  is  processed,  the  system  is  ready  for
   timesharing.   (Refer  to  Section  4.5.1  if  you  are  going to have
   operator coverage, or Section 4.5.2 if  you  are  not  going  to  have
   operator coverage.)

                                    NOTE

           During  system  initialization,  TOPS-20  defines  the
           logical  name  BS:   to  be  the  physical name of the
           structure from which TOPS-20 was booted, that is,  the
           boot structure, also known as the system structure.

           The logical  name  PS:   (public  structure)  is  also
           defined  to be this structure.  If your system manager
           later enables the "login structure" facility, however,
           PS:   refers  to  the  login  structure,  not the boot
           structure.



   4.5  READYING THE SYSTEM FOR TIMESHARING   4.5  READYING THE SYSTEM FOR TIMESHARING

   As you saw in previous sections, once RSX-20F and TOPS-20  are  loaded
   and started, SYSJOB starts running under job 0.  SYSJOB then reads and
   prints on the CTY  the  file  <SYSTEM>n-SYSJOB.RUN  and  performs  the
   commands  in  that  file.   These  commands start certain programs and
   issue some commands which aid you  and  the  system  in  providing  an
   efficient timesharing facility.

   To see what commands  SYSJOB  actually  performs,  look  at  the  file
|  PS:<SYSTEM>n-SYSJOB.RUN.   The  following  example  illustrates a file
|  that is similar to the one distributed with the software:

        RUN SYS:INFO
        RUN SYS:ORION
        RUN SYS:QUASAR

        JOB 2 /LOG OPERATOR XX OPERATOR
        ENA
        RUN SYS:NETCON
        /

   This file causes SYSJOB to:

        1.  Run ORION, the program that handles the operator interface.

        2.  Run INFO, the program that passes message identifications for
            any process that requires IPCF communications.

        3.  Run QUASAR, the program that handles the  system  queues  for
            batch jobs and print requests.

        4.  Run MOUNTR, the  program  that  handles  all  tape  and  disk
            mounting procedures.

        5.  Run MAILER, the program that handles messages sent via MAIL.

        6.  Run MAPPER, the program that sets up the program cache.

        7.  Run LPTSPL, the program that handles the line printer.

        8.  Run CDRIVE, the program that handles the card reader.

        9.  Run SPRINT, the program that handles the conversion  of  card
            images to ASCII and the interpretation of control cards.

       10.  Create a job on the system and log it in under OPERATOR.  All
            text between the slashes is passed to the job.  Any input and
            output for the job is printed on  the  CTY  and  preceded  by
            SJ  0:  until you attach to that job (Section 4.5.1).  SYSJOB
            identifies the job as job 0, but the  system  job  number  is
            one.

   ^ESPEAK    for    details   on   SYSJOB   commands.    Remember   that
   <SYSTEM>n-SYSJOB.RUN must contain only SYSJOB commands.)

   The n-SYSJOB.RUN  file  causes  the  job  under  OPERATOR  to  do  the
   following:

        1.  Enables capabilities.  This enables the OPERATOR  capability,
            normally granted to the OPERATOR directory.

        2.  Does a ^ESET LOGINS ANY to allow LOGINs from all terminals.

        3.  Does  a  ^ESEND  to  send  the  message   SYSTEM IN OPERATION
            followed by a bell to all terminals.

        4.  Runs PTYCON.

        5.  Starts various programs under PTYCON by using the contents of
            the file SYSTEM:7-PTYCON.ATO.

   The PTYCON.ATO file causes PTYCON to do the following:

        1.  Silence output to the CTY from PTYCON until PTYCON  processes
            a  NO SILENCE  command.   This eliminates unnecessary output.
            Therefore, you do  not  see  many  of  the  following  PTYCON
            actions printed on the CTY.

        2.  Create  a  LOG  file  (PTYCON.LOG)  under  <OPERATOR>.   This
            contains a record of everything that happens under PTYCON.

        3.  Connect to  subjob  0  and  log  it  in  under  OPERATOR.   A
            fictitious  password  of  FOO  is  acceptable  in  this case,
            because the job running PTYCON is  already  logged  in  under
            OPERATOR.

        4.  Print the status of all subjobs (WHAT ALL).   Because  PTYCON
            continues  processing  PTYCON  commands  while  it passes off
            commands to subjobs, the WHAT ALL output  may  appear  before
            the subjobs have finished processing their commands.

   When output to the CTY has stopped, you are at OPR command  level  and
   the  system  is  ready  for  timesharing.   The  front-end and TOPS-20
   monitors are running,  and  SYSJOB  and  the  programs  under  it  are
   running.   However,  the CTY is not attached to any of these jobs.  If
   you are going to have operator coverage,  you  should  attach  to  the
   PTYCON  job running OPR (Section 4.5.1).  Otherwise, you should set up
   the system for no operator coverage (Section 4.5.2).

   If your system manager wants SYSJOB to perform  functions  other  than

   4.6  STARTING UP A SYSTEM IN A CFS-20 CLUSTER   4.6  STARTING UP A SYSTEM IN A CFS-20 CLUSTER

   It is important that TOPS-20 systems clustered on  a  CI  be  able  to
   communicate  with each other and with HSC disk subsystems.  Therefore,
   when a CFS system initializes, it makes sure that it has: (1) an  open
   virtual circuit to the CI nodes that are already running and (2) a CFS
   connection to the TOPS-20 nodes among them.  If there are problems  in
   either  area,  the system sends a message to the CTY and then suspends
   the initialization process.  The system appears to hang.



   4.6.1  Virtual Circuits   4.6.1  Virtual Circuits

   The CI20 creates a "system block" for each node that has responded  to
   its  start-up  request  for  recognition.  This block allows a virtual
   circuit to be established between  the  starting  system  and  another
   node.   (A  virtual  circuit  is  a  software  mechanism  that  allows
   inter-system communication and data transmission over  the  CI.)  When
   the  CI20 is unable to create the block, the following message is sent
   to the CTY:






                                    4-32
                        STARTING THE HARDWARE SYSTEM                        STARTING THE HARDWARE SYSTEM


   %CANNOT JOIN CLUSTER WITH NODE nn BECAUSE:  No System Block created

   where:  nn is the decimal number assigned to the  other  CFS  node  at
   installation

   This situation is often the result of a problem at the  remote  node's
   CI20.   You can usually correct the problem by shutting down that node
   and restarting it.  But first, examine CI-related BUGINFs and  BUGCHKs
   on each system's CTY to get a clue to the problem.

|  If the CI20 is unable to  create  a  virtual  circuit,  the  following
|  message is printed:
|  
|  %CANNOT JOIN CLUSTER WITH NODE nn BECAUSE:  No open Virtual Circuit

   At least one KLPOVC BUGINF appears on the  CTY  for  every  successful
   open virtual circuit.



   4.6.2  CFS Connections   4.6.2  CFS Connections

   After a virtual circuit has  been  established,  the  starting  system
   tries  to  make  a  "CFS  connection," by way of the circuit, to every
   TOPS-20 system that is already running.  When the system cannot make a
   CFS connection, the following message is sent to the CTY:

   %CANNOT JOIN CLUSTER WITH NODE nn BECAUSE:  No CFS connection

   where:  nn is the decimal number assigned to the  other  CFS  node  at
   installation

   As with virtual  circuit  problems,  you  should  look  at  CI-related
   problems on each system's CTY.

|  A CFCONN BUGINF  appears  on  the  starting  system's  CTY  for  every
|  successful CFS connection.
|  
|  After a starting system has been successfully connected to all  nodes,

   5.1  INTRODUCTION TO THE OPERATOR INTERFACE   5.1  INTRODUCTION TO THE OPERATOR INTERFACE

   The Operator Command Language (OPR) provides you, the  operator,  with
   one  command  language  to  communicate with various components of the
   TOPS-20 operating system.  These components are:

        1.  QUASAR, the Batch System Nucleus

        2.  BATCON, the Batch Controller

        3.  LPTSPL, the Line-Printer Spooler

        4.  CDRIVE, the Card-Reader Spooler

        5.  SPRINT, the Reader Interpreter

        6.  SPROUT, the Card-Punch and Paper-Tape-Punch Spooler

        7.  MOUNTR, the Tape-Drive and Disk-Drive Controller

        8.  NEBULA, the cluster GALAXY inter-system message router

        9.  LISSPL, the cluster printer server  for  remote-node  cluster
            print requests

   In addition, you can use this same command language to interface  with
   any program requesting operator action to be taken, such as the PLEASE
   program, and with any user on the system.  The program  that  receives
   the  OPR  commands and communicates with all the other system programs
   is ORION.

   5.2  RUNNING OPR   5.2  RUNNING OPR

   To  start  OPR,  you  must  have  WHEEL,  OPERATOR,  or  SEMI-OPERATOR
   privileges.   (See  your  system manager to obtain these privileges if
   you do not already have them.)

   To handle all batch software tasks and all PLEASE, MOUNT, and DISMOUNT
   requests,  you  must  have  OPR  running.   Normally,  commands in the
   PTYCON.ATO file start  OPR  automatically  as  a  PTYCON  subjob.   An
   example of the PTYCON.ATO file is shown below.

   The command TAKE SYS:SYSTEM.CMD in the above command file executes any
   number   of  OPR  commands  to  set  and  start  devices  and  streams
   automatically.  An example of the SYSTEM.CMD file is shown below.

                                    NOTE

           It is the responsibility of  your  system  manager  to
           determine  whether OPR is to run as subjob 0 of PTYCON
           or  as  another  subjob.   In  addition,  your  system
           manager  should determine whether any other program or
           utility should be started as a PTYCON subjob.

           The tasks in this part and the following parts  assume
           that   you,  the  operator,  have  only  one  terminal
           available to perform the various tasks.  If  there  is
           more  than one terminal available to you, you may want
           to dedicate one terminal  to  run  only  OPR  and  use
           another  terminal  for  the various tasks, for example
           DUMPER.  One reason you would  use  two  terminals  is
           that while you were running a program like DUMPER, you
           could not receive any messages sent to or from OPR  on
           the  terminal  running  DUMPER.   However,  you  could
           receive the OPR messages on the terminal running OPR.

   To start OPR yourself under  a  job  with  OPERATOR  capability,  type
   ENABLE and then type OPR.

         ________        $OPR<RET>
        OPR>

   If possible, you should have one hard-copy terminal dedicated to  OPR.
   The  reason  for  this  is that OPR is your primary interface with the
   operating system and its devices.  You can dedicate the CTY to running
   OPR  and  logging system messages by simply not using it for any other
   work.  You need not log in a job or ATTACH to any of  the  subjobs  of
   SYSJOB.   In  the  following  example  your  password  is FOO and your
   account is OPERATOR:

   If you choose to dedicate a hard-copy terminal to OPR, you can  ATTACH
   the job running PTYCON to the CTY.

   If your installation has  more  than  one  terminal  assigned  to  its
   operators,   you  can  run  multiple  copies  of  OPR  from  different
   terminals.  (See Section 5.2.2.) Thus, OPR can run as a  subjob  under
   PTYCON  at  one  terminal  and as a job by itself at another terminal.
   All OPRs have the same functionality as the OPR running as a subjob of
   PTYCON  and  connected  to the CTY.  ORION, OPR's controlling program,
   can handle an unlimited number of OPRs running.

   When you issue a command to OPR, it checks  the  command  for  format,
   syntax,  and  the placement of switches and values.  If the command is
   correct,  OPR  passes  the  command  to  ORION.   If  the  command  is
   incorrect,  OPR  outputs  an  error  message.  If you receive an error
   message, you can retype the entire OPR command,  or  press  CTRL/H  to
   reprint  the command up to the point where the error occurred.  (Refer
   to Section 5.3.3.)

   To exit from OPR at any time, type the EXIT command.  You  immediately
   return  to  TOPS-20  command level and are prompted by the dollar sign
   ($).  For example:

            _________        OPR>EXIT<RET>
        $

   If OPR is a subjob of PTYCON, you can type CTRL/X to return to  PTYCON
   command level.  For example:

            __        OPR>^X
        PTYCON>

   In addition, you can also give the PUSH command to OPR  to  return  to
   TOPS-20  command  level.  You can execute any program or task and then
   give the POP command to return to OPR.  When you give the PUSH command
   to OPR, any messages sent to OPR will be displayed on the CTY.

   5.2.1.1  DECnet and  IBM  Networks   5.2.1.1  DECnet and  IBM  Networks - If  your  system  is  part  of  a
   network,  you  can  have a TOPS-20 host with up to three communication
   front-ends.  These communication front-ends can control  DECnet-20  or
   IBM  communications software.  OPR provides you with the facilities to
   communicate with IBM-type termination stations, and to communicate  in
   a minimal fashion with an IBM* host.

   The /NODE:   switch  is  available  with  many  of  the  OPR  commands
   described  in  this  manual.  The /NODE:  switch allows you to specify
   the logical identifier (name) optionally followed by two  colons  (::)
   of a remote station in your system network.  This switch is valid only
   if  your  installation  has  installed  the  TOPS-20  DECnet  software
   package.   If DECnet is present, there can be remote station operators
   in the network.

   If you are a remote station  operator,  the  OPR  processing  at  your
   station  can  only  control  the  devices at your remote station.  All
   commands you specify default to your node in the  messages  passed  to
   ORION.   Therefore,  you  need not specify the /NODE:  switch with any
   OPR command for your node.  However, when you want to refer to another
   node  on  the  system,  you must specify the /NODE:  switch in the OPR
   command.

   In addition, you have complete control over all  jobs  located  and/or
   queued  for  your node, as compared with the Central Site operator who
   has control of all jobs and devices at all nodes on the system.

   A DECnet network will also enable you to start,  stop,  and  otherwise
   manipulate  printers connected to remote nodes in a CFS-20 cluster, as
   well as obtain information on them.  In addition, print  requests  can
   be  queued  to  printers connected to VMS systems.  These printers are
   Distributed Queue Service (DQS) devices or CFS-20 cluster printers.

   Table 5-1 shows the commands that you can use from your local terminal
   for remote control in various types of networks.



   5.2.1.2  Local Area Networks   5.2.1.2  Local Area Networks - Your system may be part of a local area
   network,  with  systems  and  output devices interconnected on the NI.
   Here, users can send output requests  to  printers  connected  to  LAT
   servers.    As  an  operator,  you  can  start,  stop,  and  otherwise
   manipulate these Local Area  Transport  (LAT)  printers,  as  well  as
   obtain information on them.

   You can perform these tasks from an OPR terminal on your local system.



   5.2.1.3  CFS-20 Clusters   5.2.1.3  CFS-20 Clusters - There may be up to four systems in a CFS-20
   cluster sharing disk resources at your site.  In this type of network,
   if the cluster GALAXY facility is enabled, OPR lets you send  messages
   to  users  on  remote  systems,  get remote-system status information,
   mount/dismount remote structures, and  control  printers  on  all  the
   systems.

   Table 5-1 shows the commands you can use  from  a  local  terminal  in
   various  types of networks.  The /CLUSTER-NODE:  and /NODE:  switches,
   as well as the CFS, DQS, and LAT keywords, available with many of  the
   OPR  commands,  provide  the means for you to accomplish many of these
   remote activities.

   5.2.2  Multiple Operators on the System   5.2.2  Multiple Operators on the System

   You can have more than one job  running  OPR  on  the  same  operating
   system.   ORION  keeps  track  of  each  OPR and sends the appropriate
   acknowledgement messages to the OPR that sent the command.

   Each OPR that is processing can be set to enable or disable the  types
   of  messages that are displayed at that OPR console.  Refer to Section
   5.4.1 for descriptions of the DISABLE and ENABLE commands.



   5.3  OPR COMMAND FEATURES   5.3  OPR COMMAND FEATURES

   The OPR command language has three command features that allow you  to
   do the following:

        1.  List available commands - ?

        2.  Use recognition - <ESC>

        3.  Reprint faulty commands - <CTRL/H>

   The command features are described in detail in the following sections
   of this manual.

   If you are a  remote  station  operator,  you  cannot  use  the  above
   features.   However,  you can obtain help with the HELP command at OPR
   command level.  See Section 5.3.4.

   Other CTRL/character commands such as CTRL/R and  CTRL/U  function  at
   OPR command level as they do at TOPS-20 command level.

   5.3.1  ?  (Question Mark) - Listing Available Commands   5.3.1  ?  (Question Mark) - Listing Available Commands

   The question mark feature lists all available commands to OPR.  If you
   are  in the process of entering a command, the question mark lists any
   command keywords, arguments, or switches  for  the  command  and  then
   retypes  your OPR command up to the point where you typed the question
   mark.

   When you type a ?  to OPR, it lists the available commands.  When  you
   type  a  ?   after an OPR command, OPR lists the available keywords to
   that command.  When you type a ?  after the  keyword,  OPR  lists  the
   available  values, arguments, and/or switches to that keyword.  If you
   type a ?  after an entire OPR command, OPR responds with  the  message
   "confirm with carriage return", retypes your entire command, and waits
   for you to press the carriage return key.

   Only the OPR  commands  EXIT  and  PUSH  do  not  have  any  keywords,
   arguments, or switches.

   After you have started OPR and the system prompts you with OPR>,  type
   a ?.

   5.3.2  ESCape - Using Recognition   5.3.2  ESCape - Using Recognition

   The ESCape key allows recognition input and guide words to  appear  on
   your console when you give an OPR command.

                                    NOTE

           All OPR commands accept  recognition  input  when  you
           press  the  ESCape  key  and most OPR commands provide
           guide words within parenthesis.  However, this is  the
           only  section  of  this  manual  that  describes  this
           feature of the OPR command language.

   Type the OPR command  ABORT  with  the  use  of  the  ESCape  key  for

           If the terminal makes a bell-like sound, it is because
           the  character  you  typed  is  not  unique.   If this
           happens, type  in  another  character  and  press  the
           ESCAPE  key.  Continue to do this until the characters
           you typed are unique to the specific command.



   5.3.3  CTRL/H - Reprinting Faulty Commands   5.3.3  CTRL/H - Reprinting Faulty Commands

   The CTRL/H command causes OPR to retype your last command  up  to  the
   point  where  the  error occurred.  An OPR error message occurs when a
   command does not have the correct format, syntax, switch, or value.

   Specify the OPR command FORWARDSPACE, in  its  abbreviated  form,  but
   mistype  the  numeric  value for the /PAGES:  switch.  After you press
   CTRL/H, enter the correct numeric value.

   5.3.4  Getting Help from OPR   5.3.4  Getting Help from OPR

   Instead of using the question mark feature to list available commands,
   their keywords, and their arguments or switches, you can give the HELP
   command to OPR.

   The keyword to the HELP command is any of the OPR commands.  When  you
   give  the HELP command in this format, OPR prints on your terminal the
   function of  the  command  you  specify  with  its  format,  keywords,
   arguments, and switches.

   Specify HELP RELEASE and OPR prints the  function,  format,  keywords,
   and arguments of the RELEASE command.

                The RELEASE command allows you to release a job request
                that was held with the HOLD command.

                The format is:

                RELEASE keyword

                where keyword must be one of the following:

   5.4  ORION TO OPR MESSAGES   5.4  ORION TO OPR MESSAGES

   There are two types of messages that can appear at your OPR terminal.

        1.  OPR error messages (see Section 5.5.)

        2.  ORION to OPR messages

   The types of ORION messages that can appear are:

        1.  Errors generated when ORION accepts an OPR command, but  does
            not have the appropriate devices, streams, nodes, or jobs

        2.  Messages from jobs that start processing within a  stream  or
            on a device

        3.  Messages from jobs that end processing within a stream or  on
            a device

        4.  Messages specifying actions that you must perform for various
            devices, streams, or jobs

        5.  Messages to which you must RESPOND

        6.  Results from TAKE command files

        7.  Messages from NEBULA, in a CFS-20 configuration with  cluster
            GALAXY  enabled,  related  to structure MOUNTs/DISMOUNTs that
            involve remote systems in the cluster, SENDs to remote  nodes
            in  the  cluster,  status of remote nodes in the cluster, and
            other cluster-GALAXY activity

   Each OPR command that is sent to ORION is time stamped by  ORION  when
   the command is accepted and executed.  The acceptance and execution of
   the command is then returned to the OPR terminal  in  the  form  of  a
   message  with  the  time  stamp  as  the first eight characters of the
   message.  ORION to  OPR  error  messages  are  also  time-stamped  and
   displayed  at  the  OPR terminal in the same format.  For example, the
   OPR command:

            ___ _______ _ __________ ___________        OPR>SET PRINTER 0 FORMS-TYPE NARROW<RET>

   prints on your terminal an ORION message in the format:

        hh:mm:ss        Printer 0  --Set Accepted--

   where hh is the hour, mm is the minutes, and ss is  the  seconds  that
   the  command  was accepted and executed.  Likewise, when ORION accepts
   an OPR command, but returns a message, that message will also  contain
   a time stamp.  For example, the OPR command:

            ____ _____________        OPR>SHOW MESSAGES<RET>


                                    5-13

   displays  the  following  information  message  when  there   are   no
   outstanding messages to respond to:

        hh:mm:ss        --No Outstanding Messages--

   When a particular job starts to process within a batch stream or on  a
   device,  ORION  displays  a message at your OPR terminal to notify you
   that the stream or device is active.  For example:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  -Begin--
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA

        OPR>

   appears on your terminal when a job named TEST begins  to  process  in
   batch  stream  0 for user ZINA.  The hh:mm:ss at the beginning of this
   message is the time that the job started to process.

   Likewise, when a particular job ends its  processing  within  a  batch
   stream  or  on a device, ORION displays a message at your OPR terminal
   to notify you that the stream or device is not active and the job  has
   completed.  For example:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  -ENDED--
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA

        OPR>

   appears on your terminal when a job named TEST ends the processing  in
   batch  stream  0 for user ZINA.  The hh:mm:ss at the beginning of this
   message is the time that the job ended the processing (hours, minutes,
   seconds).



   5.4.1  Controlling OPR Message Output   5.4.1  Controlling OPR Message Output

   You can control the types of messages that  appear  at  your  terminal
   with  the  use  of the OPR commands ENABLE and DISABLE.  When you give
   either of these commands specify the OUTPUT-DISPLAY keyword  with  one
   or more of the arguments described below.

   The ENABLE  OUTPUT-DISPLAY  command  and  the  DISABLE  OUTPUT-DISPLAY
   command  provide  the  mechanism  so that each terminal running OPR at
   your installation can have its own set of messages  appearing  on  its
   terminal.   Below  are  the descriptions of available arguments to the
   OUTPUT-DISPLAY keyword.

   ALL-MESSAGES                      prints all messages.  These messages

|  
|  You can give a command that is processed on a remote cluster node  and
|  that  may result in an ORION message.  The message is displayed to all
|  the operators on the remote system, and then it is sent to your  local
|  node  where  it  is  displayed  to  local  operators  who have ENABLED
|  OUTPUT-DISPLAY for that message type from the remote node.
|  
|  You can use the following commands to control ORION output in a CFS-20
|  cluster:
|  
|        o  ENABLE/DISABLE BROADCAST-MESSAGES
|  
|           The ENABLE BROADCAST-MESSAGES command allows  ORION  messages
|           generated  on the local node to be sent to one or more remote
|           cluster nodes.  Furthermore, it allows the selective  sending
|           of  these  messages.   For  instance, you may want all except

   When OPR is running, it may print various  error  messages.   All  OPR
   error  messages  begin  with  a  ?   and  are  followed by the message
   explaining the error.  In addition, the ?  does not represent a  fatal
   error in OPR as it does in some other system programs.

   When you receive an error message, you can  press  CTRL/H  (to  retype
   your  OPR  command  up  to  the  point where you entered the incorrect
   keyword, switch, or value)  and  specify  the  correct  input  to  the
   command.   As  with  all  OPR commands, if you do not know the command
   format or you have forgotten the keywords, switches, or values, type a
   ?  and OPR lists the command arguments that you can specify.

   The batch system operates under the control of the  TOPS-20  operating
   system  and  increases the efficiency of the system by processing jobs
   that do not require human interaction.  These types of jobs are  those
   that  are  large  and long-running, jobs that require large amounts of
   data, jobs that are frequently  run  for  production,  and  jobs  that
   require no interaction with the user.

   OPR allows you to communicate with the various batch system components
   and  with the job requests that process jobs on the devices controlled
   by these components.  This  chapter  describes  the  OPR  commands  to
   accomplish these various batch software tasks.

   ORION is the interface between OPR and  all  other  batch  components.
   ORION logs each OPR command it receives and then passes the command to
   the appropriate program.

   QUASAR, the system queue manager, is the heart of  the  batch  system.
   It  is  responsible  for  scheduling  all  batch jobs entered into and
   processed from the system  queues  by  the  components  in  the  batch
   system.   BATCON,  the  batch  controller,  is the system program that
   initiates and controls the processing of batch jobs.   QUASAR  selects
   jobs  from  the  batch  input  queue  and  gives  them  to  BATCON for
   processing.  The OPR commands that have BATCH-STREAM  as  an  argument
   are the commands that allow you to control batch job processing.

   LPTSPL, the line-printer spooler, is a program that handles a specific
   printer  and  all  the  print  requests for the system including those
   submitted through the PRINT command,  spooled  requests  generated  by
   user  programs,  and  batch  job log files.  QUASAR selects jobs to be
   printed according to a variety of parameters.  The OPR  commands  that
   have PRINTER as an argument are the commands that allow you to control
   line printer processing.

   CDRIVE and SPRINT are responsible for the card-reader  input.   CDRIVE
   reads  cards  from the card reader(s), places the data on the cards on
   disk, and queues  a  request  for  SPRINT.   SPRINT  reads  the  data,
   interprets the $JOB card and other control cards, and then creates and
   submits the user's batch job to BATCON.  The OPR  commands  that  have
   READER  as  an  argument or keyword are the commands that allow you to
   control card reader processing.

   SPROUT, the card punch, paper-tape punch, and plotter spooler, is  the
   program  that  handles all the output requests other than line printer
   requests.  QUASAR selects data to be output on these devices according
   to  a  variety  of parameters.  The OPR commands that have CARD-PUNCH,
   PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH, and PLOTTER as arguments are the commands that allow
   you to control the output processing on these devices.

   NEBULA routes messages from the local ORION and QUASAR to  NEBULAs  on
   the  remote systems in the same CFS-20 cluster.  It routes messages to
   remote nodes in the cluster when you mount a  structure  on  a  remote
   system  or  dismount  a  structure  that  has been mounted on a remote
   system, request queue or other system information for remote nodes, or
   set a structure EXCLUSIVE.

   LISSPL "listens" for  print  requests  from  users  on  remote  CFS-20
   systems  in  the  cluster  and  routes  them  to  the local QUASAR for
   service.

   6.2  BATCH RESPONSIBILITIES   6.2  BATCH RESPONSIBILITIES

   The batch software handles many tasks for  you.   However,  there  are
   still  many  operations  for you to perform in order to keep the batch
   system running efficiently.  These operations  are  important  because
   the  user  is  absent  and  dependent  on you to see that his jobs are
   completed.

   In the batch operating environment, your responsibilities are to:

        1.  Set batch-stream and peripheral parameters.

        2.  Adjust the parameters if necessary.

        3.  Service action requests from user jobs.

        4.  Maintain peripheral devices.

        5.  Get the cards read through the card reader when there  are  a
            large number of batch jobs being submitted on cards.

   If users are submitting batch jobs on card decks, your system  manager
   should establish for you:

        1.  Where the decks must be placed for submission

        2.  When the decks are read

        3.  Where and when the decks and output are returned to users

   In addition to the above tasks, you should  periodically  examine  the
   queues and be able to modify the requests if necessary.



   6.3  CONTROLLING BATCH STREAMS   6.3  CONTROLLING BATCH STREAMS

   Before any batch request can be processed by the TOPS-20 batch system,
   batch  streams must be started so that the jobs can run.  In addition,
   you must have QUEUE-REQUESTS enabled so that all users can  issue  the
   SUBMIT  and  PRINT  commands.   If QUEUE-REQUESTS is disabled, and you
   give a SUBMIT or PRINT command, you receive a message specifying  that
   QUEUE-REQUESTS  is  disabled,  then  give  the  ENABLE  QUEUE-REQUESTS
   command from OPR command level.

        7.  SHOW PARAMETERS BATCH-STREAM

        8.  SHOW STATUS BATCH-STREAM

|  The following sub-sections describe each of the commands  above.   You
|  can  use the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch with each command to control batch
|  streams on specified nodes in a CFS-20 cluster.



   6.3.1  Setting Batch Stream Parameters   6.3.1  Setting Batch Stream Parameters

   Normally, a defined number of batch streams are started  automatically
   at  system start-up by the SYSTEM.CMD file.  This number is determined
   by your system manager.  However, you might start an additional  batch
   stream when there are more batch jobs than there are timesharing users
   on the system.  The parameters on any batch stream are used  to  limit
   the  use  of  that  stream  to  requests that meet a particular set of
   criteria.  Before you start the batch stream, set the  parameters  for
   the stream.  The default parameters for a batch stream are:

        1.  OPR-INTERVENTION

        2.  PRIORITY-LIMITS 1:63

        3.  TIME-LIMITS 0:600

   The OPR-INTERVENTION  parameter  specifies  that  the  user  can  pass
   messages  to you through the batch job and you can perform the actions
   requested, such as a tape mount or a structure dismount.   If  you  do
   not  want  OPR-INTERVENTION  to be in effect, set the batch stream for
   NO-OPR-INTERVENTION.  Then, any batch request  that  executes  in  the
   stream  and requests operator intervention is logged out automatically
   by the system.

   The PRIORITY-LIMITS parameter  allows  you  to  specify  the  priority
   (numeric  importance)  of  a batch stream or a range of batch streams.
   The default limits are from 1 to 63.  The greater the number  is,  the
   higher  the  priority.   If  you set a batch stream to have a priority
   limit of 31:41, only those batch requests submitted  with  a  priority
   limit of 31 to 41 are allowed to execute in that batch stream.



                                    6-4

   The TIME-LIMITS parameter allows you to specify the maximum  execution
   time  (in  minutes)  for  a  batch request to execute in the specified
   stream.  The default is from 0 to 3600 minutes.  If a job exceeds  the
   time  limit, it receives an additional 10% of the allotted time before
   the job is canceled automatically by the system.  If you set  a  batch
   stream  to  have  a  time  limit from 0 to 5 minutes, only those batch
   requests that are submitted with a time limit of 5 minutes or less are
   allowed to execute in that batch stream.

                            ----- Example -----

   Set a batch stream for NO-OPR-INTERVENTION with a priority limit of 50
   and a time limit of 90 minutes.

   6.3.2  Starting Batch Streams   6.3.2  Starting Batch Streams

   Once you have set the parameters for a particular batch  stream  or  a
   range of batch streams, you can then start the stream(s) so that batch
   requests can be scheduled.  If you do not set any parameters  for  the
   stream,  the stream takes the default values described in the previous
   section.

   You can start one or more batch streams at a time.

   To stop the scheduling of batch job requests in a batch  stream  after
   you have started it, use the SHUTDOWN command.

                            ----- Example -----

   Issue the START BATCH-STREAM command to start up streams 6 and 7.

   6.3.3  Stopping Batch Streams Temporarily   6.3.3  Stopping Batch Streams Temporarily

   If you ever need to temporarily stop a batch  stream  or  a  range  of
   batch  streams,  use  the STOP command.  The STOP BATCH-STREAM command
   temporarily stops a batch stream from processing a job.  You must  use
   the  CONTINUE  command  to  resume the batch stream.  However, in some
   instances the job cannot be continued, depending upon the  point  when
   you issued the STOP command.

   The STOP command has three optional arguments.  They are:

        1.  AFTER CURRENT-REQUEST

        2.  AFTER EVERY-REQUEST

        3.  IMMEDIATELY

   The IMMEDIATELY argument is the default for the STOP  command.   Refer
            _______  __________  _______  ________ _________ ______   to  the  TOPS-20  Operator's  Command  Language Reference Manual for a
   complete description of these commands.

                            ----- Example -----

   Stop the processing of a job in batch stream 4 temporarily because  it
   is taking too much CPU time.

   You can give the CONTINUE command to continue the processing of a  job
   (or  jobs)  in  a  batch  stream or a range of batch streams that were
   temporarily stopped with the STOP command.

                            ----- Example -----

   Continue the processing of a job in batch stream 4.

   6.3.5  Shutting Down Batch Streams   6.3.5  Shutting Down Batch Streams

   If at any time you need to permanently stop a batch stream or a  range
   of  batch  streams,  use  the SHUTDOWN command.  If a job is currently
   processing in the batch stream, the shutdown is  first  scheduled  and
   when that job has been completed, the batch stream is shutdown.

   You must issue the START command to start a batch stream after it  has
   been SHUTDOWN.

                            ----- Example -----

   Shutdown batch stream 5 while a job is still processing in it.

   6.3.6  Sending Messages to Batch Streams   6.3.6  Sending Messages to Batch Streams

   When you need to send a message to a job in a batch stream,  give  the
   SEND BATCH-STREAM command.  You can specify a single-line message with
   the SEND command or press RETURN immediately after  the  batch  stream
   number  and  enter  as many lines as you need to.  You must then press
   CTRL/Z to terminate  the  SEND  command.   You  cannot  specify  batch
   streams in the SEND command.

                          ----- Restriction -----

   The batch stream to which you send the message must be active.  If the
   batch stream is not active, you receive the following message:

   streams.  If you do not specify a single stream number or a  range  of
   stream  numbers, the SHOW command defaults to all the batch streams in
   the system.

   The output from the SHOW command displays for each batch stream:

   At any time, you can display the status of one or more  batch  streams
   with  the  SHOW  STATUS BATCH-STREAM command.  If you do not specify a
   batch stream number or a range of numbers, the command defaults to all
   batch streams in the system.

   The output from the SHOW command displays for each batch stream:

        1.  the number of the batch stream

        2.  the current status of the batch stream

        3.  the name of the job currently active in the batch stream

        4.  the request-id of the job

        5.  the name of the user who made the job request

   The following are the OPR commands that allow  you  to  control  batch
   jobs that users submit with the TOPS-20 SUBMIT command:

        1.  SHOW QUEUES BATCH-JOBS

        2.  HOLD BATCH-JOBS

        3.  RELEASE BATCH-JOBS

   The following sub-sections describe how to use each of these  commands
|  to  control  batch  jobs.  You can use the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch with
|  each command to control batch jobs on  specified  nodes  in  a  CFS-20
|  cluster.



   6.4.1  Examining Batch Jobs in the Queues   6.4.1  Examining Batch Jobs in the Queues

   Whenever a user submits a batch job, the job  is  placed  in  a  queue
   where  it  waits  for selection by the batch system for execution.  To
   examine the queues for batch jobs at any time, give  the  OPR  command
   SHOW QUEUES BATCH-JOBS.

   The  output  of  the  SHOW  QUEUES  BATCH-JOBS  command  displays  the
   following information for each job that is waiting or running:

        1.  the name of the batch job

        2.  the request-id number of the batch job

        3.  the scheduled run time of the batch job

        4.  the name of the user who submitted the batch job

   These four columns of the display appear  whether  the  batch  job  is
   currently running (active) or not running (not active).

   If the batch job is active in the batch stream, the display  shows  in
   which  stream the job is active, the job number, the last control file
   label encountered by the job, and the run time used.

   The display also includes the name of the CFS-20 node where the  batch
   stream  resides  and  the  times  that  the  remote node processed the
   command and the local system received the information, if you used the
   /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.

   The SHOW QUEUES BATCH-JOBS command has five optional switches:

        1.  /NODE:name displays the batch queue of a remote system  whose
            jobs are to be processed on the local system.

        2.  /ALL adds to the display the switches that the user specified
            with  the SUBMIT command.  If no switches were specified, the
            /ALL switch displays the default switches.  In addition,  the
            /ALL  switch  displays  any  switches that you specified, for
            example, /HOLD.

        3.  /SHORT displays only the job name, the  request  number,  the
            scheduled run time, and the user name.

        4.  /USER:name displays only the batch jobs of a specified user.

        5.  /CLUSTER-NODE:name displays the batch queue of the  specified
            remote  CFS-20  node.  If * is specified, the batch queues of
            all systems in the cluster are displayed.

                              ----- Hint -----

   The asterisk (*) before the  batch  job  name  column  (see  examples)

   6.4.2  Holding Batch Jobs   6.4.2  Holding Batch Jobs

   Whenever you need to prevent a batch job  from  processing,  give  the
   HOLD  BATCH-JOBS  command.   When  you  give this command, the current
   job(s) in the queue (as specified  by  one  of  the  arguments  listed
   below)  is  kept from being processed.  Any batch jobs submitted after
   the HOLD command are not held and are processed when a batch stream is
   available.   You must specify one of the following arguments with this
   command:

        1.  The request-id number, which holds a single batch job

        2.  The user name, which holds all batch jobs submitted  by  that
            user

        3.  An asterisk (*), which holds all batch jobs submitted by  all
            users

                             ----- Hints -----

   You cannot HOLD a batch job  that  is  currently  active  in  a  batch
   stream.

                            ----- Example -----

   Give the HOLD BATCH-JOBS command to hold all batch requests  for  user

   asterisk  (*)  for  all batch jobs in the system.  The RELEASE command
   reschedules the job(s) for processing.

                              ----- Hint -----

   6.4.4  Canceling Batch Jobs   6.4.4  Canceling Batch Jobs

   At various times, you might have to cancel a batch  job  while  it  is
   executing  in a batch stream.  You can give the ABORT command with the
   batch stream number and one or more of the following switches:

        1.  /REQUEST-ID:

        2.  /ERROR-PROCESSING, /NOERROR-PROCESSING, or /PURGE

        3.  /REASON:

   The /REQUEST-ID:  switch uniquely identifies the job to be canceled.

   The  /ERROR-PROCESSING,  /NOERROR-PROCESSING,  and   /PURGE   switches
   specify if there are error recovery procedures provided by the user or
   if the system is to flush the entire job from the system  when  it  is
   canceled.  You can specify only one of these switches.  The default is
   /ERROR-PROCESSING.

   The /REASON:  switch allows you to enter one or more lines of text  to
   explain why the batch job is being canceled.

                            ----- Example -----

   Give the ABORT  command  to  cancel  a  batch  job  that  requested  a
   structure that does not exist.

   6.4.5  Requeuing Batch Jobs   6.4.5  Requeuing Batch Jobs

   At various times you might want to cancel a batch job  that  is  being
   processed and then reschedule it to be processed at a later time.  You
   can give the REQUEUE command to HOLD the batch job in its entirety and
   to ABORT its current processing.

   For example, you might want to  REQUEUE  a  batch  job  that  requires
   additional  structures  for  its  processing,  but you do not have any
   available disk drives.  Thus, you REQUEUE the job in its entirety  for
   processing when the disk drives become available.

   You can specify the /REASON switch to explain why  the  job  is  being
   requeued.

                            ----- Example -----

   Give the REQUEUE command to hold a batch job that requests  four  tape
   drives that are not available.

   single batch request-id number, a user name for all requests  by  that
   user, or an asterisk (*) for all batch requests in the queue.

   You must specify a new PRIORITY number from 1 to 63.  The  higher  the
   number, the greater the priority.

   6.4.7  Deleting Batch Requests   6.4.7  Deleting Batch Requests

   number, a user name for all jobs by that user, or an asterisk (*)  for
   all batch requests in the queue.

   If you CANCEL a batch request that is active in a  batch  stream,  the
   batch  job  is deleted immediately from the batch stream.  In this way
   the CANCEL command is the same as the ABORT  command.   The  log  file
   shows a message indicating that the job was deleted by the operator.

                            ----- Example -----

   Give the CANCEL command to batch request  168  from  the  batch  input

                              ----- Hint -----

   This command requires that you specify a  batch  stream  number.   The
   criteria  for  selecting a batch stream are dependent on your site and
   the immediate status of the batch streams.  If you look at the  active
   jobs in the batch streams, you might recognize a long running job, and
   thus avoid that stream.  Or the user may simply request that  his  job
   run in a certain stream.

   6.5  CONTROLLING THE LINE PRINTER   6.5  CONTROLLING THE LINE PRINTER

   To handle users' requests to have files printed, you must have one  or
   more  line  printers set for the parameters of the users' requests and
   the line printer(s) must be started.  Normally,  the  line  printer(s)
   are  automatically started at system start-up when the SYSTEM.CMD file
   is executed.

   After several listings have been printed, you must  remove  them  from
   the  line  printer,  separate  them, and distribute them.  Your system
   manager should set up the distribution method which includes:

        1.  Where you must put the listings so that users can  pick  them
            up

        2.  When you must distribute them

   The following are the OPR commands that allow you to control printers:

        1.  SET PRINTER

        2.  START PRINTER

   The following sub-sections describe each of the commands  above.   The
   commands  let  you  control  local printers, attached to the system on
   which you are working, as well as remote printers.

   Note that local printers can include those attached to terminal lines:


                                    6-18

   Letterwriter  100 (LA100), LA50, or DECprinter III (LA120-RA and -RB).
   They are called terminal printers.

   You specify a remote printer with one of the following keywords to the
   commands above with the appropriate arguments:

   _______   CLUSTER -- a printer connected to another TOPS-20 system in the CFS-20
   cluster.

   ___   DQS -- a printer connected to a VMS system in the DECnet network.

   ___   LAT -- a printer connected to a LAT server in the local area network.

|  You can use the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch with each  command  to  control
|  printers on specified nodes in a CFS-20 cluster.

   Refer to Table 5-1 for the complete list of remote-operator commands.



   6.5.1  Setting the Line Printer   6.5.1  Setting the Line Printer

   Normally, a defined number of line printers are started  automatically
   at system start-up by the SYSTEM.CMD file.  However, you might have to
   start a line printer, for example, when a user requests a printer  for
   his  own use.  Before you start a line printer, you can optionally set
   the parameters for the line printer with the SET PRINTER command.  The
   parameters for this command are:

        1.  FORMS-TYPE

        2.  LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION

        3.  PAGE-LIMITS

        4.  PRIORITY-LIMITS

   These parameters are set  by  your  system  manager  at  GALGEN  time.
                    _______  __ _____ _ ____________ _____   (Refer  to  the  TOPS-20  KL Model B Installation Guide for the GALGEN
   procedures.) When you change  the  FORMS-TYPE,  LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION,
   PAGE-LIMITS,  or  PRIORITY-LIMITS for a printer, the change remains in
   effect until you make another change.

   The FORMS-TYPE parameter specifies the name of the form or the name of
   the  form  type.   The name of the form should be the same as the form
   name  in  the  LPFORM.INI  file.   Refer  to  Section  6.6.1  for  the
   description  and  use  of the LPFORM.INI file.  This parameter applies
   only to local and LAT printers.

   The LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION parameter specifies  what  action,  if  any,
   should  be  taken if a printer job exceeds the output limit set by the
   user.  You can set this parameter to:


                                    6-19

        1.  RESPOND with either IGNORE (to continue  the  print  job)  or
            ABORT (to cancel the print job)

        2.  Always ABORT the print job when the limit has been exceeded

        3.  Always IGNORE the output page limit of the line printer

   The PAGE-LIMITS parameter specifies the  minimum-to-maximum  range  of
   pages allowed to print per job on the line printer.

   The  PRIORITY-LIMITS  parameter  specifies  the  range  of  print  job
   priorities  that  the printer accepts.  For example, if a print job is
   queued with a priority of 19 and there are no line printers that  have
   been  set  to accept a priority of 19, the print request is queued but
   not printed.  The request remains in the  print  queue  until  a  line
   printer has been set to accept that priority.  However, you can change
   the priority number of a print request with the MODIFY  PRINT-REQUESTS
   command.  (Refer to Section 6.7.6.)

                            ----- Example -----

   Set line printer 0 to print requests with a priority from 1 to 21  and
   a page limit from 1 to 1000.

   6.5.2  Starting the Line Printer   6.5.2  Starting the Line Printer

   Once you have set the parameters for one or more  line  printers,  you
   can then start the printer(s) so that print requests can be processed.
   If you do not set any parameters for the printer, the  parameters  are
   the parameters set by your system manager at GALGEN time.

   You can start one or more (local only) line printers at a time.

   6.5.3  Stopping the Line Printer Temporarily   6.5.3  Stopping the Line Printer Temporarily

   If you need to stop one or more line printers, use  the  STOP  PRINTER
   command.   The STOP PRINTER command temporarily stops the line printer
   from printing its current job.  You must give the CONTINUE command  to
   allow the line printer to continue printing the job.

   The STOP command has three optional arguments.  They are:

        1.  AFTER CURRENT-REQUEST

        2.  AFTER EVERY-REQUEST

        3.  IMMEDIATELY

   If at any time you need to shut down the scheduling of print  requests
   for  one  or more line printers, use the SHUTDOWN command.  If a print
   request is currently printing on the  line  printer,  the  request  is
   completed before the line printer is shut down.

   To start the scheduling of jobs on the line  printer,  use  the  START
   command.

                            ----- Example -----

   Shutdown line printer 2 while a request is still printing on it.

   6.6  CONTROLLING FORMS ON THE LINE PRINTER   6.6  CONTROLLING FORMS ON THE LINE PRINTER

   The following are the OPR commands that allow you to control the forms
   on local line printers:

        1.  ALIGN PRINTER

        2.  BACKSPACE PRINTER

        3.  FORWARDSPACE PRINTER

        4.  SUPPRESS PRINTER

   You can give the above commands  either  while  the  line  printer  is
   printing  the  job or after you have pressed the ONLINE/OFFLINE key on
   the line printer.  When you put the line printer off-line,  OPR  sends
   the following message to the CTY.

        hh:mm:ss        Printer n  --Offline--

   When you put the  line  printer  on-line,  the  line  printer  resumes
   printing.

   In addition, the SET PRINTER n or LAT FORMS-TYPE name command  permits
   you to change the type of forms on the line printer.  If you specify a
   forms type that does not have an entry in  the  LPFORM.INI  file,  the
   forms characteristics default to:

        1.  /BANNER:2

        2.  /HEADER:2

        3.  /LINES:60

        4.  /VFU:NORMAL

        5.  /WIDTH:132

        6.  /TRAILER:2

   Refer  to  Section  6.6.1  for   a   complete   description   of   the
   SYS:LPFORM.INI file and its available switches.

   To allow yourself or a user to change the forms on a line printer,  be
   sure you have OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE set.  (See Section 8.1.)

   Note that the LP05 and  LP14  line  printers  have  a  direct  access,
   vertical  format unit.  (Refer to MAKVFU.DOC and MAKVFU.HLP.) However,
   the LP10 line printer uses a standard sprocketed carriage tape for the
   vertical format unit.

   When the first job request starts  to  print,  the  following  message
   appears,  indicating  the  forms  type being loaded into the printer's
   vertical format unit (VFU):

        hh:mm:ss        Print n  --Loading VFU with 'forms-type'--

   This is strictly an informational message  that  appears  because  the
   system reads the LPFORM.INI file when you start a line printer.

   The following sub-sections describe how to use the LPFORM.INI file and
|  how  to  use  each  of  the  commands  listed  above.  You can use the
|  /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch with each command to control forms on specified
|  nodes in a CFS-20 cluster.



   6.6.1  The LPFORM.INI File   6.6.1  The LPFORM.INI File

   The LPFORM.INI file allows you to set various  printer  parameters  on
   the basis of form names:

   Each line in the LPFORM.INI file is written in the following format:

        formname:locator/switch1/switch2/switch3...

   where:

        formname            is a 1- to 6-character form name.  The system
                            manager  should  specify  form names that are
                            descriptive of the types  of  forms  used  at
                            your installation.

        :locator            is an optional locator field containing:

     /ALIGN:filespec        The filespec specifies the  file  with  the
                            extension  .ALP, which is used to align the
                            forms on the line printer.  If no  filespec
                            is  specified,  the  system  uses  the file
                            whose filespec is the  name  of  the  form.
                            For   example,   /ALIGN   for  NARROW  uses
                            SYS:NARROW.ALP by default.   The  alignment
                            occurs before the requested file is printed
                            and is not repeated  if  multiple  requests
                            for  the same forms occur for the same line
                            printer.

     /BANNER:nn             The value of nn  specifies  the  number  of
                            banner  pages  (job  header pages) desired.
                            The default is 2 pages and may  be  changed
                            with GALGEN.

     /CHAIN:xxx             The  xxx  represents  a 1-  to  6-character
        or                  ASCII  string that  specifies  the chain or
     /DRUM:xxx              drum to be used on the printer.  The system
                            types  the switch name and argument on your
                            terminal when the forms are scheduled.   If
                            you  specify  both  the  /CHAIN  and  /DRUM
                            switches  for  the  same   entry   in   the
                            LPFORM.INI  file,  OPR prints only the last
                            one it encounters.

     /HEADER:nn             The value of nn  specifies  the  number  of
                            file  header pages desired.  The default is
                            2 pages and may be changed with GALGEN.

     /LINES:nn              The value of nn  specifies  the  number  of
                            lines  that  can  be  printed on each page.
                            The default is 60.  This switch  should  be
                            included  whenever a form type is longer or
                            shorter than the normal 60 lines.

     /NOTE:text             The  text  represents  text  of  up  to  50
                            characters   that  is  typed  on  your  OPR
                            terminal at the time the forms and/or print

     /RAM:name              The name represents  a  1-  to  6-character
                            ASCII string that specifies the name of the
                            control RAM to be used.   The  /RAM  switch
                            loads   a   special   program  that  allows
                            character translation on the line  printer.
                            If  the  line  printer has a program loaded
                            RAM (DARAM), the system automatically loads
                            it from the file SYS:name.RAM.

                            For example, if your line  printer  doesn't
                            print  left  and  right angle brackets, you
                            could specify a RAM file that would convert
                            angle  brackets  to  square brackets on the
                            line-printer output.

     /RIBBON:name           The name represents  a  1-  to  6-character
                            ASCII  string  that  specifies  the type of
                            ribbon to be used on the line printer.  The
                            system  types  the switch name and argument
                            on your terminal at the time that the forms
                            are scheduled.

     /TAPE:name             The name  represents  a  1- to  6-character
         or                 ASCII  string that specifies  the  name  of
     /VFU:name              the vertical forms control tape to be used.
                            If  the  line  printer has a program loaded
                            VFU (DAVFU), the system automatically loads
                            it from the file SYS:name.VFU.  If the line
                            printer does not have a DAVFU,  the  system
                            notifies  you of the need to change the VFU
                            tape.  The default VFU name is NORMAL.

     /TRAILER:nn            The value of nn specifies the number of job
                            trailer  pages  desired.   The default is 2
                            pages and may be changed with GALGEN.

     /WIDTH:nn              The value of nn  specifies  the  number  of
                            characters  per  line  for  the  form.  The
                            default width is 132 if the  /WIDTH  switch
                            is not specified.  The /WIDTH switch should
                            be included whenever  a  form  is  narrower
                            than the standard 14-inch wide paper.
   ______________________________________________________________________


   The form name in LPFORM.INI need not be the name of a  physical  form;
   however,  it  ought to specify the type of form (such as NORMAL forms,
   NARROW forms, and so forth).  When a print  request  is  made,  LPTSPL
   compares  the form name associated with the request with the form name
   of the form currently mounted on the line printer.  If the first  four
   characters  of  the name are not the same, then LPTSPL requests you to
   change the forms on the line printer.  If the first four characters of
   the name are the same, then LPTSPL checks the switches associated with
   the requested form name and uses those values when printing the job.
                                    6-32
                            BATCH SOFTWARE TASKS                            BATCH SOFTWARE TASKS


   If the forms type specified by the user is not the same  as  the  form
   that  is  currently  in  the  printer,  the system uses the first four
   characters to check against the LPFORM.INI file.  (This four-character
   uniqueness  can  be  changed  by  GALGEN; the default is four.) If the
   forms type matches one in the file, a  request  is  made  for  you  to
   supply  the  appropriate  form.   If  the  forms  type  is  not in the
   LPFORM.INI file, you receive an error.

   For example, note the following LPFORM.INI file:

        NARROW/HEADER:1/BANNER:1/TRAILER:1
        NARR01/HEADER:0/BANNER:1/TRAILER:1
        NARR02/HEADER:0/BANNER:0/TRAILER:0/NOTE:SPECIAL

   Now, suppose that NARR01 forms  are  currently  mounted  on  the  line
   printer  and  a user makes a print request that requires NARR02 forms.
   The system compares the first four characters of  the  requested  form
   name  (NARR02) with the first four characters of the form name for the
   form that is currently mounted on the line printer (NARR01).   Because
   they  are the same, the system takes the switch values associated with
   NARR01 and applies them to the user's print request.   Therefore,  the
   LPFORM.INI  file  should  contain unique form names for each different
   type or form.  This ensures that the correct forms are mounted when  a
   user submits a print request.

   Each line in LPFORM.INI  can  also  contain  a  locator  field,  which
   specifies  the  parameters  a  form  should have when it is mounted on
   specific line printers.  For example:

        NORMAL:LPT001/HEADER:1/BANNER:1/TRAILER:0
        NORMAL:ALL/HEADER:2/BANNER:2/TRAILER:2

   If form NORMAL is printed on line printer LPT001, it takes  the  forms
   parameters  given  in  the  first  entry  of the LPFORM.INI file shown
   above.  If form NORMAL is printed on any other line printer,  then  it
   takes the forms parameters given in the second entry of the file.

   Note that entries in LPFORM.INI having identical form names but having
   different  locators  must  be  listed  from  specific  locator to more
   general locator.  In the example above, the  entry  specifying  device
   LPT001 for form NORMAL appears before the entry specifying locator ALL
   for the same form name.  This order is important because  LPTSPL  uses
   the  first  entry  in  LPFORM.INI that can be applied to the device on
   which the request is printed.

   Also, note that ALL is the default locator value.  For example,

        NORMAL/switches

   6.6.2  Aligning Forms on the Line Printer   6.6.2  Aligning Forms on the Line Printer

   At various times during your daily system operation, you might have to
   align  special  forms for a particular line printer job.  For example,
   you might have to load payroll checks on the  line  printer  for  your
   scheduled payroll process.  The ALIGN command allows you to adjust the
   forms on the line printer as many times as necessary to print the  job
   correctly.

   When you give the ALIGN PRINTER command, the system uses an  alignment
   file that is specified as "formsname.ALP" for the print request, where
   formsname is the name of the form that was  specified  in  the  user's
   print request.  The "formsname.ALP" file contains a pattern applicable
   to the special forms being mounted.  If you do not  want  the  default
   .ALP  file  used,  you can specify another alignment file in the ALIGN
   PRINTER command.  For example, the  file  for  NORMAL  forms  at  your
   installation could be:

        SYS:<SPOOL>NORMAL-ALIGN.ALP

   In addition, the ALIGN PRINTER command  has  three  optional  switches
   that you can specify to:

        1.  Change the number of seconds between the repeat  printing  of
            the .ALP file (/PAUSE:  switch)

        2.  Change the number  of  printing  repeats  of  the  .ALP  file
            (/REPEAT-COUNT:  switch)

        3.  Resume normal printing and stop aligning special forms (/STOP
            switch)

   When you specify either  of  these  switches,  you  are  changing  the
   default  for  the  current  job  on the printer.  When you specify the
   /STOP switch, the printer stops printing the contents of the .ALP file
   and resumes printing the print request.

                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  Give the ALIGN PRINTER command to align  forms  for  a  print
            request  for  payroll  checks.   At  your  installation,  the
            /PAUSE:  switch was set for 10 seconds and the /REPEAT-COUNT:
            switch was set for 25 repeats.  Change the /REPEAT-COUNT:  to
            15.

   6.6.3  Backspacing Forms on the Line Printer   6.6.3  Backspacing Forms on the Line Printer

   At various times, you might have to backspace a particular  file  that
   is  being  printed  on the line printer, such as when the forms become
   jammed in the printing mechanism.  The BACKSPACE command allows you to
   backspace  the  print  file  so  that  the pages of the file that were
   jammed or incorrectly printed can be reprinted.

   With the BACKSPACE PRINTER  command,  you  must  specify  one  of  the
   following switches:

        1.  /COPIES:  - specifies the  number  of  copies  of  the  print
            request to backspace.

        2.  /FILE - specifies to backspace 1 file so that it  is  printed
            again.

        3.  /PAGES:  - specifies the number of pages to be backspaced and
            printed again.

   When you give a BACKSPACE PRINTER command, the system first clears the
   printer  buffer  by  printing  its  contents,  and  then executes your
   command.  The number of pages that are printed to clear the buffer are
   included with the number of pages you specify in the BACKSPACE PRINTER
   command.  Therefore, when you specify the /PAGES:  switch, you  should
   add  two  or  three  pages  to  the  total number given as the /PAGES:
   value.

                            ----- Example -----

   Printer 1 has just had a paper jam which has put the printer off-line.
   The following messages appear at your console:

        OPR>

   Clear the printer of the jammed pages and re-align the forms.   Before
   you  put  the  printer  on-line, give the BACKSPACE PRINTER command to
   repeat the number of pages that were jammed and add a couple of  pages
   for  the  printer  buffer (the following example describes backspacing
   printer 1 by 25 pages).  Then RESPOND to message <12>.

   At this point, the line printer prints the remaining contents  of  the
   printer buffer and then backspaces 25 pages to reprint what was jammed
   or incorrectly printed.



   6.6.4  Forwardspacing Forms on the Line Printer   6.6.4  Forwardspacing Forms on the Line Printer

   At various times, you might have to  forwardspace  a  particular  file
   that  is  being  printed  on  the  line  printer,  such as when a user
   requests only a portion of some file to be printed.  The  FORWARDSPACE
   command allows you to forwardspace the file so that you can save paper
   and print only what is needed.

   With the FORWARDSPACE PRINTER command, you must  specify  one  of  the
   following switches:

        1.  /COPIES:  - specifies the  number  of  copies  of  the  print
            request to forwardspace.

        2.  /FILE - specifies to forwardspace 1 file in the  print  queue
            so that the file is not printed.

        3.  /PAGES:  - specifies the number of pages of the print request
            that are not printed.

   When you give a FORWARDSPACE PRINTER command, the system first  clears
   the  printer  buffer  by  printing its contents and then executes your
   command.  The number of pages that are printed to clear the buffer  is
   included  with  the  number  of  pages you specify in the FORWARDSPACE
   PRINTER command.  Therefore, when you specify the /PAGES:  SWITCH, YOU
   SHOULD  SUBTRACT  TWO  OR THREE PAGES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER GIVEN AS THE
   /PAGES:  value.

   A user issued  the  command  @PRINT  A.TXT,B.TXT,C.TXT,D.TXT  and  has
   requested  you  to forwardspace line printer 2, so that the B.TXT file
   is printed before the A.TXT file is printed.  After the print job  has
   printed  the  header  and  banner pages, you put the printer off-line,
   give the FORWARDSPACE PRINTER command for 1 file,  and  then  put  the
   printer on-line.

   6.6.5  Suppressing Carriage Control on the Line Printer   6.6.5  Suppressing Carriage Control on the Line Printer

   At various times, you might have to suppress the carriage  control  on
   the  line  printer for a particular job, such as when a user's program
   causes a print loop that makes the forms  in  the  line  printer  pass
   through  with  one  line  written  on each form.  The SUPPRESS command
   allows you to suppress the carriage control.

   The SUPPRESS PRINTER command  suppresses  all  blank  lines  and  form
   feeds.   For  example, if you had a 25-page file with one line of text
   per page, the SUPPRESS PRINTER command would cause all  the  lines  of
   text to print on one page.

   With the  SUPPRESS  PRINTER  command,  you  can  specify  one  of  the
   following switches.

        1.  /FILE - suppresses blank lines and form feeds for the current
            file printing.

        2.  /JOB - suppresses blank lines and form feeds for  the  entire
            job printing.

        3.  /STOP - stops the suppression of printing and resumes  normal
            printing with blank lines and form feeds.

   The /JOB switch is the default if you do not specify any of the  above
   switches.

   6.7  CONTROLLING LINE PRINTER JOBS   6.7  CONTROLLING LINE PRINTER JOBS

   The following OPR commands allow you to control line printer jobs that
   a  user  queues  either with the processing of a batch job or with the
   TOPS-20 PRINT command:

        1.  SHOW QUEUES PRINTER-JOBS

        2.  HOLD PRINTER-JOBS

        3.  RELEASE PRINTER-JOBS

        4.  ABORT (current job on) PRINTER

        5.  REQUEUE (current job on) PRINTER

        6.  MODIFY PRINTER-REQUEST

        7.  CANCEL PRINTER-REQUEST

        8.  NEXT (job on) PRINTER

   The following sub-sections describe how to use each of these  commands
|  to  control line printer jobs.  You can use the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch
|  with each command to control line printer jobs on specified nodes in a
|  CFS-20 cluster.



   6.7.1  Examining Printer Jobs in the Queues   6.7.1  Examining Printer Jobs in the Queues

   Whenever a user issues a request for the line printer, the request  is
   placed  in  a  queue  where  it  waits for selection by the system for
   printing.  To examine the queues for print jobs, give the OPR  command
   SHOW QUEUES PRINTER-JOBS.

   The output of the SHOW QUEUES PRINTER-JOBS command displays  for  each
   job:

        1.  The name of the print job

        2.  The request-id number of the print job

        3.  The page limit of the print job

        4.  The name of the user who requested the print job

   These four columns of the display appear  whether  the  print  job  is
   currently  printing  (active)  or  is  not  printing  (inactive).   In
   addition to the above, if the job is active on the line  printer,  the
   display  also  shows  the line printer unit number on which the job is
   printing, the time that the print job started, and the total number of
   pages printed.

   The display also includes the  name  of  the  CFS-20  node  where  the
   printer  was  started and the times that the remote node processed the
   command  and  the  local  system  received  the  information,  if  you
   specified /CLUSTER-NODE:  on the command line.

   The SHOW QUEUES PRINTER-JOBS command has five optional switches:

        1.  /NODE:name displays the printer  queue  of  a  remote  system
            whose jobs are to be processed on the local node.

        2.  /ALL adds to the display the switches that the user specified
            with  the  PRINT command.  If no switches were specified, the
            /ALL switch displays the default switches.  In addition,  the
            /ALL  switch  displays  any  switches that you specified, for
            example, /HOLD.

        3.  /SHORT displays only the job name, the  request  number,  the
            scheduled run time, and the user name.

        4.  /USER:name displays only the printer job of a specified user.

        5.  /CLUSTER-NODE:  name displays printer queue information  from
            the  specified  remote  CFS-20  node.  If * is specified, the
            printer names of all nodes in the cluster are displayed.

   6.7.4  Canceling Printer Jobs   6.7.4  Canceling Printer Jobs

   At various times, you might have to cancel a printer job while  it  is
   printing.  You can give the ABORT command with the printer unit number
   and one or more of the following switches:

        1.  /REQUEST-ID:

        2.  /PURGE

        3.  /REASON:

   The /REQUEST-ID:  switch uniquely identifies the job to be canceled.

   The /PURGE switch flushes the entire job from the system  when  it  is
   canceled.   There are no header, banner, or trailer pages printed when
   the print request is purged.

   The /REASON:  switch allows you to enter one or more lines of text  to
   explain why the printer job was canceled.

   You can also specify remote-printer command keywords to  cancel  print
   jobs requested on DQS, LAT, or cluster printers.

   6.7.5  Requeuing Printer Jobs   6.7.5  Requeuing Printer Jobs

   At various times, you might want to cancel  a  printer  job  and  then
   reschedule it to be printed at a later time.  You can give the REQUEUE
   command to HOLD the printer job in its entirety and ABORT its  current
   printing.  This command can only be used when the job is active.

   For example, you might want to REQUEUE a  printer  job  that  requires
   multiple  boxes  of forms so that it prints at a later time when fewer
   users are requesting printer jobs.  Thus, you REQUEUE the job  in  its
   entirety for printing when the time becomes available.

   In order to have the job start again after it has been  requeued,  you
   must give the OPR command RELEASE.

   You can specify the /REASON switch to explain why  the  job  is  being
   requeued.

   You can requeue remote DQS, LAT, and cluster printer jobs as  well  as
   local printer jobs.

   Whenever you need to change the priority of a printer job  request  in
   the queue, give the MODIFY PRINTER-REQUEST command.  You can specify a
   single printer request-id number, the user name for  all  requests  by
   that user, or an asterisk (*) for all printer requests in the queue.

   You must specify a new PRIORITY number from 1 to 63.  The  higher  the
   number, the greater the priority.

                            ----- Example -----

   Give the MODIFY command to change the priority of batch request 135 to
   have  a  priority  of  63.  This causes the request to be the next job
   processed.

   Whenever you need to delete a printer request from the printer  queue,
   give  the  CANCEL  PRINTER-REQUEST  command.  You can specify a single
   request-id number, the user name for all jobs  by  that  user,  or  an
   asterisk (*) for all printer requests in the system.

   When you delete a print request that  is  currently  printing  on  the
   printer,  the  printer  stops  printing  the  data, prints the trailer
   pages, and starts printing the next job in the queue.

                            ----- Example -----

   6.7.8  Sending Line Printer Output to Tape   6.7.8  Sending Line Printer Output to Tape

   You can send output to a magnetic tape instead of a line printer  with
   the OPR command, START PRINTER nn /DEVICE:MTAn:.

   The advantages for doing this are:

        1.  When your line printers are down due to a  hardware  problem,
            you can spool the output to tape and then copy this output on
            another system where the printer(s) is not down.

        2.  When it is desired to microfiche the output, you can send the
            output to tape instead of printing it on the line printer.

        3.  When you want to transfer the output from one site to another
            or to another system, you can put it on tape.  Transferring a
            tape is easier than mailing or carrying the printed output.

   To perform this task, do the following:

        1.  Type to OPR:

            ___ __________ _____ ________________            SET TAPE-DRIVE MTAn: UNAVAILABLE<RET>

            where n is the tape drive unit  number.   (Refer  to  Section
            7.5.7  for  additional  information  on  the  SET  TAPE-DRIVE
            command.)

        2.  Physically mount and bring on-line a tape on the  tape  drive
            that   has   been  made  UNAVAILABLE.   Make  sure  that  the
            write-ring has been inserted in the tape (WRITE-ENABLED).

            You  can  specify  the  user's  name  for  all  requests by a
            specific user or a  request-id  number  for  a  single  print

            already in use and n is the tape drive unit number.

        5.  If you are to print a type of form other than the type when a
            printer  is  started (the default) at your installation, type

   To handle a user's request to have card decks read into the system for
   batch  processing,  you  must have started one (or possibly more) card
   reader(s)  at  your  installation.   Normally,  the  card  reader   is
   automatically  started  at system start-up when the SYSTEM.CMD file is
   executed.

   Your system manager should establish the following when you have batch
   users submitting their jobs as card input:

        1.  Where the users place the card decks for submission

        2.  When you load the card decks into the card reader for reading

        3.  Where and when you place the card decks and output  from  the
            batch jobs to return to the users

   The following are the OPR commands that allow you to control the  card
   reader(s) at your installation:

        1.  START READER

        2.  STOP READER

        3.  CONTINUE READER

   The following sub-sections describe each  of  the  above  commands  to
|  assist  you  in  the  control  of  card  reader(s).   You  can use the
|  /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch with each command to control  card  readers  on
|  specified nodes in a CFS-20 cluster.



   6.8.1  Starting the Card Reader   6.8.1  Starting the Card Reader

   In order for you to load and read cards through the card  reader,  you
   must  start  the  card reader with the START READER command.  Starting
   the card reader allows batch card jobs to be scheduled for  processing
   in the TOPS-20 batch system.  You can specify one or more unit numbers
   with the START command.

   To stop the scheduling of card batch jobs on a card  reader,  use  the
   SHUTDOWN command.

                            ----- Example -----

   6.8.2  Stopping the Card Reader   6.8.2  Stopping the Card Reader

   If you need to stop one or more card readers, use  the  STOP  command.
   The  STOP  READER  command  temporarily  stops  the  card  reader from
   processing its current job.  You must give  the  CONTINUE  command  to
   allow the card reader to continue reading the input job.

   The STOP command has three optional arguments.  They are:

        1.  AFTER CURRENT-REQUEST

        2.  AFTER EVERY-REQUEST

        3.  IMMEDIATELY

   The IMMEDIATELY argument is the default for the STOP  command.   Refer
            _______  __________  _______  ________ _________ ______   to  the  TOPS-20  Operator's  Command  Language Reference Manual for a
   complete description of these commands.

   6.8.4  Shutting Down the Card Reader   6.8.4  Shutting Down the Card Reader

   If at any time you need to shutdown  the  scheduling  of  card  reader
   requests, use the SHUTDOWN command.  If a card reader job is currently
   being read from the card reader, the request is completed  before  the
   card reader is shutdown.

   To start the scheduling of jobs on the card reader, use  the  SHUTDOWN
   command.

                            ----- Example -----

   Shutdown card reader 0 while a request is still being  read  into  the
   system.

   6.8.5  Displaying Card Reader Status   6.8.5  Displaying Card Reader Status

   At any time you can display the status of one  or  more  card  readers
   with  the  SHOW STATUS READER command.  If you do not specify a number
   or a range of unit numbers, the default is all  card  readers  on  the
   system.

   The output from the SHOW STATUS READER command displays:

        1.  The card reader unit number

        2.  The current status of the card reader (either idle or active)

   If you specified the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch, the display also includes
   the  name of the remote CFS-20 node and the times that the remote node
   processed the command and the local node received the information.  If
   the  card  reader  is active, there is currently a deck of cards being
   read into the system.  The system  does  not  recognize  a  job  name,
   request-id, or user name until the last card of the deck has been read

   job  request  with  a  request-id number and can be displayed with the
   SHOW QUEUES BATCH-JOBS command.

   Because a card reader job becomes a batch input queue request when the
   last  card  of the job (EOJ card) is read, you can only abort the card
   job while it is being read into the system.

   At various times you might have to cancel the  card  job  being  read,
   such  as  when a card jam occurs in the card reader.  You can give the
   ABORT READER command by specifying the reader unit  number  to  cancel
   the job before it becomes a job request in the batch input queue.

   In addition, you can specify a reason with the /REASON:  switch as  to
|  why  the  job  was  canceled.  You can also specify the /CLUSTER-NODE:
|  switch to control card reader jobs on  specified  nodes  in  a  CFS-20
|  cluster.

   6.10  CONTROLLING OTHER OUTPUT DEVICES   6.10  CONTROLLING OTHER OUTPUT DEVICES

   The commands and descriptions in this section are applicable  only  if
   you have the hardware available at your installation site.

   Other output devices available to users are:


                                    6-52
                            BATCH SOFTWARE TASKS                            BATCH SOFTWARE TASKS


        1.  CARD-PUNCH

        2.  PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH

        3.  PLOTTER

   If your installation has one or more of these output devices, you must
   have the parameters set so that the user(s) requests can be processed.
   Normally,  if  your  installation  has   these   devices,   they   are
   automatically  started  at system start-up when the SYSTEM.CMD file is
   executed.

   When the output from the card punch, paper-tape punch, and plotter has
   been  completed,  you  must remove the output and distribute it.  Your
   system manager should set up the distribution method which includes:

        1.  Where you must put the output so that users can pick it up

        2.  When you must distribute the output

   The following commands are the OPR commands that allow you to  control
   the card punch, paper-tape punch, and plotter at your installation:

        1.  SET output device

        2.  START output device

        3.  STOP output device

        4.  CONTINUE output device

        5.  SHUTDOWN output device

        6.  SHOW PARAMETERS output device

        7.  SHOW STATUS output device

   where output device can be CARD-PUNCH, PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH, or PLOTTER.

   The following sub-sections describe each  of  the  above  commands  to
|  assist  you  in  the control of these output devices.  You can use the
|  /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch with each command to control output devices  on
|  specified nodes in a CFS-20 cluster.



   6.10.1  Setting Output Devices   6.10.1  Setting Output Devices

   Normally, a defined number of output devices  are  started  at  system
   start-up  by the SYSTEM.CMD file.  However, you might have to start an
   output device (for example, the card punch) when  a  user  requests  a
   card  punch  job.   Before  you  start  an  output device (CARD-PUNCH,


                                    6-53
                            BATCH SOFTWARE TASKS                            BATCH SOFTWARE TASKS


   PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH, or PLOTTER), you can set  the  parameters  for  that
   device.  The parameters for these three devices are:

        1.  FORMS-TYPE name

        2.  LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

        3.  OUTPUT-LIMIT number

        4.  PRIORITY-LIMITS range

   Where "name" is the name of the output device form.   The  default  is
   NORMAL  and  is  defined  in the SPFORM.INI file for each device type.
   (Refer to Section 6.10.2.)

   The "word" of  the  LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION  parameter  refers  to  what
   action,  if  any,  should  be  taken  if  the device that is currently
   processing the job request exceeds the output limit.  You can set this
   parameter to:

        1.  RESPOND with either IGNORE the limit for the  output  job  or
            ABORT to cancel the output job

        2.  Always ABORT the output job when the limit has been exceeded

        3.  Always IGNORE the set output limit of the device

   The "number" of the OUTPUT-LIMIT parameter refers to the following:

        1.  Number of cards for the CARD-PUNCH

        2.  Number of folds for the PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH

        3.  Number of units for the PLOTTER

   These parameters default to the following if they are not included  in
   the SYSTEM.CMD file at system start-up:

        1.  500 cards for the CARD-PUNCH

        2.  500 units for the PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH

        3.  500 units for the PLOTTER

   The "range" of the PRIORITY-LIMITS parameter refers to a range of  job
   priority  numbers  the  output  device  accepts.  The default priority
   range is 1:63.  For example,  if  an  output  job  is  queued  with  a
   priority of 19 and there are no devices for the request that have been
   set to accept a priority of 19, the request is not  output  until  you
   change the priority range for the device.  You can change the priority
   number of the job request with the MODIFY command  (refer  to  Section
   6.11.6).   When  you  set  an  output device to change the FORMS-TYPE,

   LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION, OUTPUT-LIMIT, or  PRIORITY-LIMITS,  the  change
   remains in effect until you make another change.

                            ----- Examples -----

   6.10.2  The SPFORM.INI File   6.10.2  The SPFORM.INI File

   The forms handler for the output devices CARD-PUNCH, PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH,
   and  PLOTTER  allows you to automatically set various forms parameters
   on the basis of form names.  To accomplish this, you  or  your  system
   manager must set up a file on SYS:  called SPFORM.INI which contains a
   list of form names and switch settings for those forms.

   Each line in the SPFORM.INI file is written in the following format:

        devtyp formname:locator/switch1/switch2/switch3...

   where:

        devtyp              the device type for which this line  applies.
                            The allowable types are as follows:

                            CDP for the card punch
                            PTP for the paper-tape punch
                            PLT for the plotter

        formname            a 1- to 6-character form name.  You  or  your
                            system  manager  should  specify  unique form
                            names that are descriptive of  the  types  of
                            forms used at your installation.

   ______________________________________________________________________


                                    NOTE

           Refer to the hardware owner's manual for  the  plotter
           device  at your installation before entering a line in
           the SPFORM.INI file for the plotter because there  are
           many different types of plotters.

   The form name in SPFORM.INI need not be the actual name of a  physical
   form; however, it usually is close to the type of form (such as normal
   forms, narrow forms, and so forth).  When a device  request  is  made,
   SPROUT  compares  the  form  name associated with the request with the
   form name of the form currently mounted on the output device.  If  the
   first  four  characters  of the name are not the same, then the system
   requests you to change the forms on the output device.  If  the  first
   four  characters  are  the  same,  then  the  system simply checks the
   switches associated with the requested form name and uses those values
   when  processing  the  output  job.  The number of characters that the
   system uses to compare the form name can be changed by running GALGEN;
   the default is four characters.

   For example, note the following SPFORM.INI file:

        CDP NORMAL/HEADER/BANNER/TRAILER
        CDP NORM01/HEADER/BANNER/TRAILER
        CDP NORM02/HEADER/BANNER/TRAILER/NOTE:SPECIAL

   Now, suppose that NORM01 forms are currently mounted on the card punch
   and  a  user makes a punch request that requires NORM02 forms.  SPROUT
   compares the first four characters of the requested form name (NORM02)
   with  the  first four characters of the form name for the form that is
   currently mounted in the card punch (NORM02).  Because  they  are  the
   same,  SPROUT  takes  the  switch  values  associated  with NORM01 and
   applies them to the user's punch request.  Therefore,  the  SPFORM.INI


                                    6-57

   file should have a unique name for each type of form.

   Each line  in  SPFORM.INI  can  also  contain  a  locator  field  that
   specifies  the  location  of  the output device.  The locator ALL (the
   default) refers to all of the devices as specified by the device type.
   The locators LOCAL and REMOTE are applicable only if your installation
   has TOPS-20 network software.



   6.10.3  Starting Output Devices   6.10.3  Starting Output Devices

   Once you have set the parameters for the  particular  output  devices,
   you  must start the device so that output requests can be processed on
   them.  If you do not set any parameters for  the  device,  the  device
   uses the default parameters set by your system manager at GALGEN time.

   You can start one output device at a time or a range of devices.

   To stop the scheduling of jobs on an output device, use  the  SHUTDOWN
   command.

                            ----- Example -----

   Issue the START CARD-PUNCH command to start up card punch 0.

   6.10.4  Stopping Output Devices   6.10.4  Stopping Output Devices

   If you ever need or want to stop one or more output devices,  use  the
   STOP  command.   The  STOP  command temporarily stops an output device
   from processing its current job.  You must use the CONTINUE command to
   resume the output to the device.

   The STOP command has three optional arguments.  They are:

        1.  AFTER CURRENT-REQUEST

        2.  AFTER EVERY-REQUEST

        3.  IMMEDIATELY

   The IMMEDIATELY argument is the default for the STOP  command.   Refer

   If at any time you need to shutdown the scheduling of output  requests
   on  an output device or on a range of output devices, use the SHUTDOWN
   command.  If an output request is currently  being  processed  on  the
   device, the request is completed before the output device is shutdown.

   To start the scheduling of jobs on the output device,  use  the  START
   command.

   6.10.7  Displaying Output Device Parameters   6.10.7  Displaying Output Device Parameters

   You can display the current output device  parameters  with  the  SHOW
   PARAMETERS device command, where device can be:

        1.  CARD-PUNCH unit-number

        2.  PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH unit-number

        3.  PLOTTER unit-number

   If you do not specify a unit number with the  device  name,  the  SHOW
   command defaults to all units of the device that you specified.

   The output from  the  SHOW  PARAMETERS  device  command  displays  the
   following for each of the three devices listed above:

        1.  The unit number for the output device

        2.  The output limits for the output device

   6.10.8  Displaying Output Device Status   6.10.8  Displaying Output Device Status

   You can display the status of an output device or a  range  of  output
   devices  with the SHOW STATUS device command.  If you do not specify a
   unit  number  or  a  range  of  unit  numbers,  the  command  displays
   information for all of the specified devices on the system.

   The output from the SHOW STATUS device command displays the  following
   for each device:

        1.  The unit number of the output device

        2.  The current status of the output device

        3.  The job name currently active on the output device

        4.  The request-id number of the job

        5.  The name of the user who made the output request

   If the output device is not active, the word  "Idle"  appears  in  the
   Status  column  with no jobname, request-id, or user name.  If none of
   the devices are active, only the unit number and status appears in the
   display.

   If an output device is active, the output also shows the time that the
   output  request  started  and the number of output cards or units thus
   far.  If you do not need this information with the display of the SHOW
   STATUS  device  command,  specify  the  /SHORT switch before you press
   RETURN to confirm the command.

   If you specifed the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch, the display also  includes
   the  remote  CFS-20  node  name  and  the  times  that the remote node
   processed the command and the local system received the information.

   6.11  CONTROLLING JOBS ON OUTPUT DEVICES   6.11  CONTROLLING JOBS ON OUTPUT DEVICES

   The following are the OPR commands that allow you  to  control  output
   device  jobs  that a user queues either with the processing of a batch
   job or with the TOPS-20 PUNCH or PLOT command:

        1.  SHOW QUEUES device-JOBS

        2.  HOLD device-JOBS

        3.  RELEASE device-JOBS

        4.  ABORT (Current Job on) device

        5.  REQUEUE (Current Job on) device

        6.  MODIFY device-REQUEST

        7.  CANCEL device-REQUEST

   Where "device" can be CARD-PUNCH, PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH, or PLOTTER.

   The following sub-sections describe how to use each of these  commands
|  to control output device jobs.  You can use the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch
|  with each command to control output device jobs on specified nodes  in
|  a CFS-20 cluster.



   6.11.1  Examining Output Device Jobs in the Queues   6.11.1  Examining Output Device Jobs in the Queues

   Whenever a user issues a request to an output device job, the  request
   is  placed  in  a queue where it waits for selection by the system for
   processing.  To examine the queues for output  device  requests,  give

   the OPR command SHOW QUEUES device-JOBS.

   The output of the SHOW QUEUES device-JOBS command displays:

        1.  The name of the output job

        2.  The request-id number of the output job

        3.  The output limit of the job

        4.  The name of the user who requested the output job

   These four columns of the display appear whether  the  output  job  is
   currently   being   processed  (active)  or  is  not  being  processed
   (inactive).

   In addition to the above, if the output is active on the  device,  the
   display  shows  the  device  unit  number  on  which  the job is to be
   processed, the time that the output started, and the total  number  of
   cards or units processed.

   If you specified the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch, the display also includes
   the  remote  CFS-20  node  name  and  the  times  that the remote node
   processed the command and the local received the information.

   The SHOW QUEUES device-JOBS command has five optional switches:

        1.  /NODE:name displays the device queue of a remote system.

        2.  /ALL adds to the display the switches that the user specified
            with  the  PUNCH  or  PLOT  command.   If  no  switches  were
            specified, the /ALL switch displays the default switches.  In
            addition,  the  /ALL  switch  displays  any switches that you
            specified, for example, /HOLD.

        3.  /SHORT displays only the job name, the  request  number,  the
            scheduled run time, and the user name.

        4.  /USER:name displays only the device jobs of a specified user.

        5.  /CLUSTER-NODE:name displays device queue information from the
            specified  remote  CFS-20  system.   If  *  is specified, the
            output queues of all nodes in the cluster are displayed.

                              ----- Hint -----

   The asterisk (*) before the job name column (see  examples)  indicates
   that the job is currently being processed.

   6.11.4  Canceling Output Device Jobs   6.11.4  Canceling Output Device Jobs

   At various times, you might have to cancel an output job while  it  is
   processing  on  a  device.   You  can  give the ABORT command with the
   output unit number and one or more of the following switches:

        1.  /REQUEST-ID:

        2.  /PURGE

        3.  /REASON:

   The /REQUEST-ID:  switch uniquely identifies the job to be canceled.

   The /PURGE switch flushes the entire job from the system  when  it  is
   canceled.   There are no header, banner, or trailer pages printed when
   the output request is purged.

   The /REASON:  switch allows you to enter one or more lines of text  to
   explain why the output job was canceled.
                            ----- Example -----

   Give the ABORT command to cancel an output  job  because  a  user  had
   requested that you do so.

   At various times, you might want to cancel  an  output  job  currently
   being  processed  and  at the same time, reschedule the same job to be
   processed at a later time.  You can give the REQUEUE command  to  HOLD
   the output job in its entirety and ABORT its current output.

   For example, you might want to REQUEUE an  output  job  that  requires
   more  forms  (cards,  paper  tape,  or  plotter  paper)  then  what is
   currently available at your site.  Thus, you REQUEUE the  job  in  its
   entirety for output to be processed when the forms become available.

   You can specify the /REASON:  switch to explain why the job  is  being
   requeued.

   You can force an output queue to schedule a particular request  to  be
   processed  immediately  by  using  the NEXT command with BATCH-STREAM,
   CARD-PUNCH, PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH, PLOTTER or PRINTER as the keyword.  This
   command  starts  the  job  immediately  after  the  current request is
   finished.  The NEXT command does  not  alter  the  sequence  of  other
   requests in the queue.

                            ----- Example -----

   Give the NEXT command to make request 230 the next job to  be  printed
   on printer 0.

   This chapter  describes  various  tasks  that  you  can  perform  when
   requested  or  needed.   Therefore,  these  tasks  are  considered  as
   unscheduled software tasks.  If any of these tasks are performed on  a
   regular  basis  at  your installation, decide upon a schedule for them
   with your system manager.

|  Note that you can use the /CLUSTER-NODE:   switch  with  the  commands
|  described  in  this  chapter  to  affect  jobs on specified nodes in a
|  CFS-20 cluster.



   7.1  CONTROLLING THE SCHEDULER   7.1  CONTROLLING THE SCHEDULER

   As the operator of the TOPS-20 operating system, you may be instructed
   by  your  system  manager  to  change  the scheduling scheme that your
   system is currently using.  The following  sub-sections  describe  the
   ways of temporarily changing the various scheduling schemes.



   7.1.1  Changing Class Scheduling   7.1.1  Changing Class Scheduling

   If your system is using class scheduling, you  may  override  whatever
   has  been  set in the n-CONFIG.CMD file for a specific class by giving
   the following OPR command:

            ___ _________ _____ _ _______        OPR>SET SCHEDULER CLASS n nn<RET>

   The first argument specifies the class number and the second  argument
   specifies  the  percentage  of  CPU  time  given  to  that class.  The
   percentage  of  CPU  time  allocated  cannot  exceed  100%.   Whatever
   percentage  of  CPU  time  is not allocated becomes part of the system
                             _______  ______  _________  _____   windfall.  (Refer to the  TOPS-20  System  Manager's  Guide  for  more
   information on class scheduling.)

   7.1.1.1  Changing a Job's Scheduling Class   7.1.1.1  Changing a Job's Scheduling Class - If your system has  class
   scheduling  controlled  by  a  policy  program, you may change a job's
   scheduling class by giving the following OPR command:

            ___ ___ _ _______________ ______        OPR>SET JOB n SCHEDULER-CLASS y<RET>

   The first argument specifies the job number and  the  second  argument
   specifies  the  class you want the job to run in.  When you issue this
   command, it temporarily places the job in the specified class.

                            ----- Example -----

   Change job 24 to run in scheduler class 3.

            ___ ___ __ _______________ ______        OPR>SET JOB 24 SCHEDULER-CLASS 3<RET>



   7.1.2  Changing Batch-Class Scheduling   7.1.2  Changing Batch-Class Scheduling

   If your system manager has specified a special  class  for  all  batch
   jobs,  you  may  change the class number or the percentage of CPU time
   allocated in  the  n-CONFIG.CMD  file  by  giving  the  following  OPR
   command:

            ___ _________ ___________ ______        OPR>SET SCHEDULER BATCH-CLASS n<RET>

   The argument can be either a class number, the word BACKGROUND, or the
   word  NONE.   If  you enter a class number, the percentage of CPU time
   specified in the n-CONFIG.CMD file for that class  will  be  given  to
   batch  jobs.   For  example,  if you change the batch class to a class
   that has been set up with 50% of the CPU time,  then  batch  jobs  for
   that  class  receive 50% of the CPU time.  If this is the case and you
   do not want batch jobs to have that percentage of CPU time, you should
   first give the SET SCHEDULER CLASS command to change the percentage of
   CPU time for that class, and then give the SET  SCHEDULER  BATCH-CLASS
   command.

   You can  change  the  percentage  of  CPU  time  for  the  batch-class
   specified  in  the  n-CONFIG.CMD file by giving the BACKGROUND or NONE
   argument.  When you give the BACKGROUND argument, batch jobs for  that
   class  receive  the percentage of CPU time that has not been allocated
   to the other classes.  When you give the NONE argument, batch jobs for
                                                           _______ ______   that  class  receive  no  CPU  time.   (Refer  to  the  TOPS-20 System
   _________ _____   Manager's Guide for more information on batch class scheduling.)

|  If you are not using the  class  scheduler,  the  BACKGROUND  argument
|  causes batch jobs to run in the lowest priority queue.

   7.1.3  Changing Bias-Control Scheduling   7.1.3  Changing Bias-Control Scheduling

   If your system is using  bias-control  scheduling,  you  may  override
   whatever has been set in the n-CONFIG.CMD file by giving the following
   OPR command:

            ___ _________ ____________ ______        OPR>SET SCHEDULER BIAS-CONTROL n<RET>

   The argument is a integer from 1 to 20.  To allocate  higher  priority
   to  interactive jobs, you would set n in a range between 1 to 10, with
   1  being  the  highest  priority.   To  allocate  higher  priority  to
   compute-bound jobs, you would set n to be in a range between 11 to 20,
   with 20 being the highest priority.

                                    NOTE

           Remember these commands only  temporarily  change  the
           scheduling  scheme.  If the system has to be restarted
           for any reason, the scheduling scheme reverts to  what
           has been set up in the n-CONFIG.CMD file.



   7.1.4  Displaying Scheduler Status   7.1.4  Displaying Scheduler Status

   At any time, you can display the status of the scheduler by giving the
   following OPR command:

            ____ ______________        OPR>SHOW SCHEDULER<RET>

   When  you  issue  this  command  the  system  prints   the   following
   information:

         o  The class scheduling status

         o  The bias-control setting

         o  The batch class

         o  The class number

         o  The percentage of CPU time allocated to each class

         o  The percentage of CPU time being used by each class

         o  The load averages for each class

         o  The windfall allocation status

         o  The accounting  mechanism  (by  accounts  or  by  the  policy
            program)

   The display also includes the name of the remote CFS-20 node  and  the
   times  that the remote node processed the command and the local system
   received the information, if you specified the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.

   The SHOW SCHEDULER command has one optional switch:

        1.  /CLUSTER-NODE:name displays scheduler  information  from  the
            specified  CFS-20  system.   If * is specified, the scheduler
            information from all nodes in the cluster are displayed.

   7.2  SETTING DEVICES ON-LINE   7.2  SETTING DEVICES ON-LINE

   If you have a DX20 channel controller installed and  on-line  at  your
   installation,  you  can  bring one of the devices listed below on-line
   with OPR after the device has been newly installed at your site.  This
   function  allows the system to accept the hardware address of a device
   that is not known to the monitor but is available for use.  You do not
   need to reload the TOPS-20 monitor.

   The devices that are interfaced through the DX20 are:

        1.  TX02 - tape controller

        2.  TX03 - channel selector




                                    7-4

        3.  TX05 - tape drive selector

        4.  TU70 - tape drive

        5.  TU71 - tape drive

        6.  TU72 - tape drive

        7.  RP20 - disk drive

   In addition, when your DIGITAL Field Service Representative takes  one
   of  these  devices  off-line for repair of a hardware problem and then
   returns the device back to you for your control, you can give the  OPR
   command:

        SET ONLINE channel,unit,controller number<RET>

   to cause the system to recognize the device as on-line and  ready  for
   use  by  the system.  The address (ch,unit,cntrlr) separated by commas
   is:

        1.  Channel number (ch)

        2.  Device unit number (unit)

        3.  Controller number (cntrlr)

   The controller number can be  omitted  if  the  device  is  interfaced
   directly to the channel bus.

                              ----- Hint -----

   If the TOPS-20 monitor is reloaded, such as after a system crash,  you
   do  not  need  to  set  the  device  on-line  again.   The  device  is
   automatically recognized by the monitor as being on-line.

                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  Set the TX02  hardware  device  on-line  after  it  has  been
            installed   during  timesharing.   Specify  the  argument  of
            channel 1, unit 1, controller 1.

   7.3  CONTROLLING THE ORION LOG BUFFER FILE   7.3  CONTROLLING THE ORION LOG BUFFER FILE

   ORION maintains  a  log  of  all  messages  sent  through  it.   ORION
   timestamps  and  identifies  the  type  of  message  and  provides any
   additional information available.  This function of ORION is  referred
   to as a Centralized Logging Facility.

   The ORION log buffer  file  contains  all  OPR-to-ORION  commands  and
   transactions  performed  at  the operator's console.  The OPR commands
   that control this logging facility are:

        1.  ENABLE LOGGING

        2.  DISABLE LOGGING

        3.  CLOSE LOG

   The Centralized Logging Facility is on by default at  system  startup,
   but  can  be  disabled  by  placing the DISABLE LOGGING command in the
   SYSTEM.CMD file or by giving this command at OPR command level.

   To enable the Centralized Logging  Facility  again,  give  the  ENABLE
   LOGGING  command  at  OPR  command  level or place this command in the
   SYSTEM.CMD file.

   The  CLOSE  LOG  command  closes  the  current  log  buffer  file  and
   automatically  creates  a  new  log  buffer  file.  When the CLOSE LOG
   command is issued, the commands and transactions recorded in  the  log
   buffer  file  are  copied  to the ORION-SYSTEM.LOG file and the buffer
   file is cleared.  You can then print the ORION-SYSTEM.LOG file on  the
   line  printer to obtain a hard copy of all the operating processes for
   a given period.

   The name of the log file is  determined  by  your  system  manager  at
                                  _______ ________ ____________ _____   GALGEN  time.   (Refer  to the TOPS-20 Software Installation Guide for

   7.4  INITIALIZING TAPES   7.4  INITIALIZING TAPES

   At various times, you are asked to initialize and/or  re-initialize  a
   magnetic tape.  When you initialize a tape, the system writes specific
   information on the tape pertaining to the identification of the  tape.
   When  you  initialize  a  tape  specifying  a TOPS-20, ANSI, or EBCDIC
   standard label, the system writes the  following  information  on  the
   tape:

        1.  A  standard   volume   label   that   contains   the   volume
            identification (volid) of the tape.

        2.  Standard header and trailer labels.  Later, when  a  file  is
            written   on   the   tape,   these  labels  contain  specific
            information pertaining to the file.

   When you initialize a tape as unlabeled, the system writes a record of
   80  null  characters  followed  by  two  tapemarks  on the tape.  This
   prevents the tape from running off the end of  the  reel  when  MOUNTR
   inspects it for a volume label.

   To initialize one or more tapes, give the following OPR command:

        OPR>SET TAPE-DRIVE MTAn:  INITIALIZE /switch:,/switch:,...<RET>

        where "n" is the unit number of the tape drive.

   The  following  table  describes  the  valid  switches  for  the   SET
   INITIALIZE command:

     /COUNT:nn                      specifies the number (nn) of  tapes
                                    to  be  initialized.   This  switch
                                    allows you to  initialize  multiple
                                    tapes  with  the  same  attributes.
                                    Every time you initialize  a  tape,
                                    the  system  asks  you  to  type  a
                                    volume identifier unless  the  tape
                                    has  only  numeric characters, with
                                    no   leading   zeroes,    in    the
                                    VOLUME-ID.   If it has only numeric
                                    characters, then the next label  is
                                    equal to the present volume-ID plus
                                    the value of the /INCREMENT switch.
                                    When  the initialization process is
                                    complete, the  system  unloads  the
                                    tape  from  the  drive.   When  the
                                    specified number of tapes have been
                                    initialized,  you  can use the tape
                                    drive   to   satisfy   user   mount
                                    requests.

     /DENSITY:nnnn                  specifies  the   density   of   the
                                    tape(s)   being  initialized.   The
                                    "nnnn" can be 200, 556, 800,  1600,
                                    or  6250.   If you do not give this
                                    switch,  the   system   uses   1600
                                    bits/in as the default.

     /INCREMENT:nn                  specifies the  numeric  value  (nn)
                                    that   is  used  to  increment  the
                                    volume identifiers.  This switch is
                                    valid  only when specified with the
                                    /VOLUME-ID switch.  If you  do  not
                                    give this switch, the system uses 1
                                    as the default.

     /LABEL-TYPE:type               specifies  the  type  of   standard
                                    volume  label  to be written on the
                                    tape.  The "type" can  be  TOPS-20,
                                    ANSI, EBCDIC, or UNLABELED.  If you
                                    do not specify a  label  type,  the
                                    system uses TOPS-20 as the default.

   /OVERRIDE-EXPIRATION:(YES or NO) specifies  whether  to  ignore  the
                                    expiration  date of the data on the
                                    tape.   If  you  specify  NO,   the
                                    system   does   not  allow  you  to
                                    initialize a tape whose  expiration
                                    date  has  not  yet  expired.  (The
                                    expiration  date  of  the  tape  is
                                    defined  as  the expiration date of
                                    the first file on the tape.) If you
                                    specify YES, the system initializes
                                    the tape  even  if  the  expiration
                                    date  has  not  been reached.  When
                                    you are initializing new tapes, you
                                    should   always   specify   YES  to
                                    prevent the tape from running away.
                                    If you do not give this switch, the
                                    system uses NO as the default.

     /OWNER:name                    specifies the name of the owner  of
                                    the   tape(s)   being  initialized.
                                    This switch is valid  only  if  the
                                    label  type  is TOPS-20.  If you do
                                    not give this switch, the  tape  is
                                    initialized as a scratch tape.

     /PROTECTION:nnnnnn             specifies a six-digit octal  number
                                    as the protection code of the tape.
                                    The number  (nnnnnn)  can  be  from
                                    000000 (no one except the owner can
                                    use  the   tape)   through   777777
                                    (anyone  can  use  the tape).  This
                                    switch is valid only if  the  label
                                    type  is  TOPS-20.   If  you do not
                                    give this switch, the  system  uses
                                    the  protection  code  of 777777 as
                                    the default.

     /TAPE-DISPOSITION:condition    specifies what is to be  done  with
                                    the   tape   after   it   has  been
                                    initialized.  The  "condition"  can
                                    be  either  HOLD or UNLOAD.  If you
                                    specify  HOLD,  the  tape   remains
                                    mounted  on  the  drive  after   it
                                    has  been  initialized.    If   you
                                    specify   UNLOAD,   the   tape   is
                                    unloaded from the  drive  after  it
                                    has  been initialized.  If you give
                                    the /COUNT:  switch  with  a  value
                                    greater       than      1,      the
                                    /TAPE-DISPOSITION  is  ignored  and
                                    UNLOAD  is assumed.  If this switch
                                    is  not  given,  the  system   uses
                                    UNLOAD as the default.

     /VOLUME-ID:volid               specifies the volume identifier for
                                    the  tape.  The  volid  can be from
                                    1 to 6  characters.   If  the volid
                                    contains  non-alphanumeric  charac-
                                    ters, you  must enclose  the  volid
                                    in double quotes (").
   ______________________________________________________________________


   When you use a tape drive for initializing tapes, the  tape  drive  is
   not  available  for  user  mount  requests.   When  the initialization
   process is completed, the tape drive automatically  becomes  available
   for user mount requests.  To force a tape drive out of initialize mode
   prematurely, refer to Section 7.5.7.

                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  A user (J.JONES) has requested a tape mount of an  ANSI  tape
            with  a volid of FOOBAR and has requested that you initialize
            the tape first.  The volume is initialized with  ANSI  labels
            and  a volid of FOOBAR.  The system default for density (1600
            BPI) is used.  When the tape is mounted  on  the  drive,  the
            tape  is  initialized  and the drive becomes available to the
            user (/TAPE-DISPOSITION:HOLD).  Automatic Volume  Recognition
            (AVR  - See Section 7.5.2) takes over and satisfies the mount
            request for FOOBAR.

   7.5  HANDLING USER MOUNT REQUESTS   7.5  HANDLING USER MOUNT REQUESTS

   There are two types of tapes you may be requested to  mount:   labeled
   tapes  and unlabeled tapes.  The differences in handling the two types
   of tape requests are explained in the  following  sections.   If  your
   system  has tape drive allocation enabled, the user must issue a MOUNT
   command to request that a tape be mounted.  When the  system  receives
   this request, OPR prints the following message:

        hh:mm:ss       -- TAPE MOUNT REQUEST#nn--
                     MOUNTlabel-typeVOLUMEvolid,n-track,nnnnBPI,mode

   7.5.2  Controlling Automatic Volume Recognition (AVR)   7.5.2  Controlling Automatic Volume Recognition (AVR)

   Automatic Volume Recognition (referred to as AVR) allows you to  mount
   a labeled tape without telling the system the volume identification of
   the tape.  When you mount a labeled tape  on  a  drive  that  has  AVR
   enabled, the system automatically reads the volume identifier from the
   volume label when the tape drive is brought on-line.

   If tape drive allocation is being used on  your  system,  then  it  is
   likely  that  AVR  has been enabled in the n-CONFIG.CMD file.  If, for
   some reason, you need to disable AVR for one or all tape drives,  give
   the following OPR command:









                                    7-18

        OPR>DISABLE AUTOMATIC-VOLUME-RECOGNITION argument<RET>

        where the argument can be:

             MTAn:  (for a specific tape drive)
              or
             TAPE-DRIVES (for all tape drives)

   One reason for disabling AVR on a tape drive is to avoid runaway tapes
   when  you  are initializing tapes.  When you disable AVR, OPR does not
   print any message confirming that AVR has been disabled.  To check the
   status  of the tape drive, give the OPR command SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE
   /ALL.

   You can enable AVR for one or more of the tape drives on  your  system
   by giving the following OPR command:

        OPR>ENABLE AUTOMATIC-VOLUME-RECOGNITION argument<RET>

                          ----- Restriction -----

                  You cannot ENABLE  or  DISABLE  AVR  for
                  7-track  tape drives.  If you attempt to
                  do  so,  the  system  will  ignore   the
                  command.   All  tapes mounted on 7-track
                  tape drives are  regarded  as  unlabeled
                  tapes.
                            ----- Example -----

            Disable AVR for tape drive 0.

   7.5.3  Mounting Labeled Tapes with AVR Enabled   7.5.3  Mounting Labeled Tapes with AVR Enabled

   When a user issues a MOUNT command for a labeled tape, you  receive  a
   message similar to the following:

        OPR>

                      User HOVSEPIAN, Job 25,Terminal 2

   If the user has not already given you the tape, the  first  thing  you
   must  do  is physically locate the tape he requested.  When you locate
   the tape, mount the tape on a drive that supports the density the user
   requested in the MOUNT command.  When the tape is brought on-line, the
   system automatically reads the label and prints a message  similar  to
   the following on your terminal:

                     User HOVSEPIAN, Job 25, Terminal 2

   When the user finishes using the tape drive, he issues a DISMOUNT TAPE
   command  to  release  the tape drive.  When he gives this command, the
   system prints a message similar to the following on your terminal:

        OPR>
        11:20:33      --Tape Drive Released by USER--
                     MTA0:  Volume 001234 being Unloaded
        OPR>

   If a tape has been mounted for a long period without being used, it is
   possible  that  the  user  forgot to give the DISMOUNT TAPE command to
   release the tape drive.  If this is the case, check with the  user  to
   see  if he is finished using the tape.  If he is, give the OPR command
   DISMOUNT TAPE.  When you  give  this  command,  the  system  prints  a
   message similar to the following on your terminal:

        OPR>
        11:45:20      --MTA0:  Unloaded--

                                    NOTE

           Tape handling error messages are explained in  Section
           9.4.7.



   7.5.4  Mounting Labeled Tapes With AVR Disabled   7.5.4  Mounting Labeled Tapes With AVR Disabled

   When a user issues a MOUNT command, you see the same mount request  as
   explained  in the previous section.  However, because AVR is disabled,
   the system does not automatically read the label.  Therefore, you must
   give  the  OPR  command  IDENTIFY  to  inform  the system of the label
   information.

   For example, a user requests a labeled tape whose volid is  112233  to
   be  mounted  on a tape drive.  You mount the tape on a tape drive that
   has AVR disabled, for  example,  MTA0:.   After  you  bring  the  tape
   on-line, give the following command:

            ________ _____ _________ ___________        OPR>IDENTIFY MTA0: VOLUME-ID 112233<RET>

   The above command tells the system that a labeled tape with the  volid
   of 112233 is mounted on tape drive MTA0:.

   If the user requests that a labeled tape be mounted as a scratch tape,

           When a user requests that a labeled tape be mounted as
           a  scratch  tape,  the  volid  in the mount request is
           replaced by the word SCRATCH.



   7.5.5  Mounting Unlabeled Tapes   7.5.5  Mounting Unlabeled Tapes

   When a user requests that an unlabeled  tape  be  mounted  on  a  tape
   drive,  the  mount  request  you  see  is  the same as the ones in the
   previous sections with the exception that the "label-type" is shown as
   unlabeled.   To  inform  the system that you are mounting an unlabeled
   tape, use the OPR command IDENTIFY.

   After you have physically located the tape and mounted it  on  a  free
   tape drive, give the IDENTIFY command to have the system associate the
   tape with the mount request.

   For example, a user requests that an unlabeled tape be mounted with  a
   volid  of  TEST01.   When  the  mount request is processed, the system
   prints the following message on your terminal:

        OPR>
        10:20:10      --Tape Mount Request #12--
                     Mount Unlabeled Volume TEST01
                     User Hovsepian, Job 21, Terminal 7
        OPR>

   When you receive this  request,  locate  and  mount  the  tape  on  an
   available tape drive and then give the following command.

            ________ _____  _________ ___________        OPR>IDENTIFY MTAn:  VOLUME-ID TEST01<RET>

   where "n" is the unit number of the tape drive.

   You can also satisfy the mount request by giving the IDENTIFY  command
   with  the request number in place of the volid.  Using the above mount
   request, give the following command:

            ________ _____  __________ _______        OPR>IDENTIFY MTAn:  REQUEST-ID 12<RET>

   If you are unable to satisfy a user's mount request,  you  can  cancel
   the  mount  request by giving the OPR command CANCEL MOUNT-REQUEST nn.
   You should also notify the user why you could not satisfy the  request
   by giving the /REASON:  switch with the command.

   For example, you cancel a mount request because you could not find the
   requested tape.  To do this, give the following command:

        OPR>CANCEL MOUNT-REQUEST nn/REASON:I COULD NOT FIND THE TAPE<RET>

   where "nn" is the request number assigned to the mount request.

   7.5.7  Setting Tape Drives Available or Unavailable   7.5.7  Setting Tape Drives Available or Unavailable

   If tape drive allocation is enabled every time you start  the  system,
   all  tape  drives  are  under control of the MOUNTR program.  However,
   there may be times you want to release MOUNTR's control  of  the  tape
   drive.  To do this, you would give the following command:

        OPR>SET TAPE-DRIVE MTAn:  UNAVAILABLE<RET>

   where "n" is the unit number of the tape drive.

   The system prints:

        ENTER TEXT AND TERMINATE WITH ^Z

   This allows you to enter a comment giving a reason why you are setting
   the tape drive unavailable.

   When you give this command, MOUNTR releases control of the tape  drive
   and  users  can  assign  the  drive  to their jobs by using the ASSIGN
   command.  To return control of the tape  drive  to  MOUNTR,  give  the
   following command:

            ___ ____ _____ _____ ______________        OPR>SET TAPE DRIVE MTAn: AVAILABLE<RET>

   7.6  ARCHIVING FILES WITH DUMPER   7.6  ARCHIVING FILES WITH DUMPER

   If your installation is using  the  archive/virtual  disk  system  for
   off-line  storage of files, you could be requested at various times to

   run the DUMPER program to copy files marked  for  archiving  onto  two
   tapes.   These  requests do not appear at OPR command level.  However,
   you can give the TOPS-20 command INFORMATION  ARCHIVE-STATUS  <*>*.*.*
   to display the files that users have requested to be archived.

         ___________ ______________ _____________        $INFORMATION ARCHIVE-STATUS <*>*.*.*<RET>

                                    NOTE

           This command shows files for your connected  structure
           only.   To show those files for another structure, you
           must  include  the  structure  name  in  the   command
           (str:<*>*.*.*).

   You can archive each file separately using the DUMPER program with the
   following command format:

        DUMPER>ARCHIVE str:<directory>filespec<RET>

   However, it is recommended that you wait until you have more than just
   one archive request to run DUMPER and archive files.

   If no filespec is given in the DUMPER command, all  files  marked  for
   archiving  on  the  connected  structure are copied to tape.  Thus the
   DUMPER command defaults to the following:

        DUMPER>ARCHIVE str:<*>*.*.*<RET>

   You must use two tapes when you are archiving files.  With two  tapes,
   the  archive  provides a backup system in case one of the tapes is bad
   or if one of the tapes gets misplaced.  Your system manager should set
   up  the  procedures  and  the  tapes that are to be used for archiving
   files.

   Archiving  requires  that  DUMPER  make  two  runs  on  the  connected
   structure.  When the files have been successfully copied to two tapes,
   DUMPER then deletes the contents of the  files  from  the  disk.   The
   following are the steps you must take to archive one or more files:

        1.  Physically mount and ready a tape that has been assigned  for
            archiving.

        2.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        3.  Type ENABLE.

        4.  Type MOUNT TAPE setname:  (setname is the name  you  assigned
            to   your   tape)   with   the   /WRITE-ENABLED  switch,  the
            /LABEL-TYPE:   switch,  the  /VOLIDS:   switch,  the  /NOWAIT
            switch,  and  any  additional  switches  desired to the MOUNT
            command.

        5.  When MOUNTR replies with  the  Tape  Mount  Request  and  the
            acknowledgment  of the unlabeled tape being mounted, type POP
            to return to OPR.

        6.  If you are using an unlabeled tape, give the IDENTIFY command
            to OPR to identify the tape drive to the mount request.

        7.  When MOUNTR replies with Tape Drive Given To Request  number,
            type PUSH to OPR.

        8.  After the system has assigned a tape drive, type DUMPER.

        9.  Type to DUMPER:

            TAPE MTn:<RET>
            ARCHIVE str:<dir>filespec<RET>

       10.  DUMPER asks you two questions.  If the tape  has  never  been
            used  before  for  archiving,  you  should answer YES to both
            questions.  If the tape has been used before  for  archiving,
            you  should  answer  NO  to the first question and the second
            question does not appear (see the example below).

       11.  When DUMPER replies with the two Total lines,  type  EXIT  to
            DUMPER.

       12.  Type DISMOUNT MTn:.

       13.  Physically remove the tape from the tape drive.

       14.  Mount and ready the second tape for the  archive  and  repeat
            Steps 4 through 13.

       15.  Type POP to return to OPR.

                            ----- Example -----

   The following is an example of the DUMPER program when used to archive
   files.   It is assumed that you have already mounted an unlabeled tape
   on MTA1:  and the tape has never been used before for archiving.

   7.7  RUNNING THE REAPER PROGRAM   7.7  RUNNING THE REAPER PROGRAM

   The REAPER program is used to increase free disk space on the  system.
   REAPER frees this disk space by performing the following functions:

        1.  By marking files that  have  not  been  referenced  within  a
            specified period for involuntary migration

        2.  By deleting disk contents pertaining to archived or  migrated
            files that have not been referenced within a specified period

        3.  By trimming directories that are over  their  permanent  disk
            allocations

   In most cases to use the REAPER program, you would give  a  number  of
   commands,  one  for  each operation to be performed.  When all desired
   operations have been specified, you can give  the  BEGIN  command  and
   specify the path of files to be considered.

   Table 7-2 below and on the following pages describe the  commands  you
   can  give  to the REAPER program and what the REAPER program does when
   it is run.


   Table 7-2:  REAPER Commands   Table 7-2:  REAPER Commands

   ______________________________________________________________________

     BEGIN (Processing Files)

     specifies which files to process in the  file  system.   Normally,
     you can specify PS:<*>*.*.*, but you can also specify other paths,
     such as PS:<*>*.REL.* or  FOO:<TST*>*.*.*.   This  command  should
     only  be  given  after  all  desired  options have been specified.

     After the specified files have been processed, REAPER  prints  the
     total number of pages reclaimed and then exits.


     DELETE-CONTENTS (of old offline files)

     specifies that files, existing on both  disk  and  on  an  archive
     tape,  that have not been referenced within a specified period are
     to have their contents deleted from disk.  The period is specified
     by  the  PERIOD  command  (described below in this table).  If the
     DELETE command is not given, the  disk  contents  of  the  file(s)
     remain on the disk(s).


     EXIT (to monitor)

     specifies to exit from the REAPER program, without processing  any
     files.


     LIST (output to file)

     specifies an output filespec for the listing produced  by  REAPER.
     This  listing  consists of the names of the files that were marked
     for migration and a list of tapes that have archived  or  migrated
     files.   If  a  tape  that was listed on a previous listing is not
     listed on the current listing, it means that the contents  of  the
     tape have expired and can be released for other purposes.  If this
     command is not given, the listing produced by REAPER is written to
     the file DSK:REAPER.LIST.


     MIGRATE (old files to offline storage)

     specifies that files not referenced within  the  specified  period
     are  to  be  marked  for  involuntary  migration.   The  period is
     specified by the PERIOD command.  If the MIGRATE  command  is  not
     given, files are not marked for migration and remain on disk.

     Files that are marked for migration have the disk contents deleted
     from  disk  when  you  run  the  DUMPER  program with the /MIGRATE
     switch.  (Refer to next section in this chapter.)


     ORDER (For trimming)

     specifies the order in which files that are marked  for  migration
     are  to  be  taken  when  trimming  a  directory  that is over its
     permanent  allocation.   This  order  list  is  made  up  of  file
     specifications,  such  as:  *.TMP.*, *.LST.*, and *.REL.*.  REAPER
     only uses the ORDER list if the TRIM command is given.

     directory.   However,  you should always include this command when
     performing trimming operations.


     PERIOD (For migration)

     specifies a time limit in days within which files  should  not  be
     migrated or have their disk contents deleted.  Your system manager
     should inform you of the number of days  to  be  entered  in  this
     command.   For  example,  if  PERIOD is 60 days, it means that all
     files older than 60 days are involuntarily migrated if the MIGRATE
     command  was  given  or  files  older than 60 days have their disk
     contents deleted if you gave the the DELETE command.

     If you do not give a PERIOD command, a default period of  60  days
     is assumed.


|    POLICY (does a TAKE on SYSTEM:REAPER.CMD)
|  
|    executes REAPER commands contained in the file SYSTEM:REAPER.CMD.


     PURGE (Expired FDBs from disk)

     specifies to delete and expunge the File Descriptor Block (FDB) of
     a  file  which  is  off-line  and  the  file's expiration date has
     arrived (or passed).  Sometime before the off-line expiration date
     is  reached,  a  message  is  sent  to  the user who owns the file
     indicating that the expiration of the file is  approaching.   This
     message is sent only once.


     SCAN (Only)            

     specifies that no files are actually DELETEd,MIGRATEd, or TRIMmed.
     Only a listing of the files and directories that would be deleted,
     migrated, and trimmed is produced if you were  to  run  REAPER  at
     this time.


     SKIP (Directories)

     specifies the directories that  are  not  to  be  considered  when
     performing  deletion,  migration,  or  trimming  operations.  Your
     system manager should inform you of the directories that should be
     skipped.  If the SKIP command is not given, all directories on the
     structure are processed.


     TAKE (Commands from file)

     specifies a command file of REAPER commands that  REAPER  executes
     automatically.   This  file should be created when the software is
     installed.  The command file should  contain  your  installation's
     policies  toward  involuntary  migration.  If you do not specify a
     filespec   with   the   TAKE   command,   REAPER    defaults    to
     SYSTEM:REAPER.CMD  as  a filespec.  (See below for an example of a
     REAPER.CMD file.)


     TAPE (Check of tapes in use)

     specifies that the output listing containing a summary of the tape
     information  for  the files considered in the REAPER process.  The
     listing shows  all  tapes  referenced  and  the  number  of  valid
     (unexpired)  files  each  tape  has.  There is no distinction made
     between archive and migration tapes.


     TRIM (Directories over allocation)

     specifies that directories over their permanent allocation will be
     trimmed  down  to the size specified in their directory.  The user
     can specify the order in which the  files  should  be  trimmed  by
     entering  an  order  list  in  a file named MIGRATION.ORDER in the
     user's directory.  If the MIGRATION.ORDER file does not  exist  in
     the  user's  directory,  then  the  order of files for trimming is
     taken from the ORDER command you specify.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   The following is an example of a REAPER.CMD file with  comments  added
   to clarify the commands:

        ! Sample REAPER policy file - Created 17 Sept 79,
        ! Directories not to consider:
        SKIP PS:<*SUBSYS>,PS:<*SYSTEM>,PS:<UNSUPPORTED>

        ORDER *.TMP.*,*.LST.* !IN WHICH TO TAKE FILES WITH TRIM

   When REAPER completes its processing, four lines of text  are  printed
   on your terminal.  These lines specify the number of:

        1.  files and pages marked for migration

        2.  archived files and pages deleted from disk

        3.  temporary files and pages deleted

        4.  expired files and pages purged

   If REAPER does not  mark  any  files  for  migration,  it  prints  the
   following information:

        0 files marked for migration, 0 pages
        0 archive files deleted from disk, 0 pages
        0 temporary files deleted, 0 pages

                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  The following is an  example  of  the  REAPER  program.   You
            specify  the SCAN and BEGIN commands.  REAPER defaults to the
            SYSTEM:REAPER.CMD file automatically for your  installation's
            migration  policies.  Within the BEGIN command, you can press
            CTRL/A and REAPER prints the current directory it is  working
            on.

   While REAPER is running, you cannot type POP to return to OPR.  If you
   are  running  REAPER  as  a subjob of PTYCON, you can type <CTRL/X> to
   return to PTYCON and CONNECT back to OPR.  It is recommended that  you
   run  REAPER  either as a subjob of PTYCON or as a batch job because of
   the length of time it takes to process.

   When REAPER has completed its processing, REAPER lists the  number  of
   files and pages marked for migration, the number of files deleted, and
   the number of files purged.  You can then EXIT  from  REAPER  and  run
   DUMPER (explained in the next section).  For example:

            169 files marked for migration, 3040 pages
            12 archive files deleted from disk, 102 pages
            13 temporary files deleted, 236 pages
            2 expired files purged, 27 pages

   7.8  MIGRATING FILES WITH DUMPER   7.8  MIGRATING FILES WITH DUMPER

   Once a file has been marked for migration you  should  run  DUMPER  to
   dump  the marked files to tape and delete (using the DELETE command in
   REAPER) the files from disk.  The contents of the  files  are  deleted
   after the second tape has been used for migration.

   Like archiving files, migration requires two  tapes.   Two  tapes  are
   used  to  provide  a back-up system in case one of the tapes is bad or
   gets misplaced.  Your system manager should set up the  procedure  and
   assign the tapes to be used for migrating files.

   You must do the following to migrate files with DUMPER:

        1.  Physically mount and ready a tape that has been assigned  for
            migrating files.

        2.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        3.  Type ENABLE.

        4.  Type MOUNT TAPE setname:  with the /WRITE-ENABLED switch, the
            /LABEL-TYPE:    switch,   the   /VOLIDS:    switch,  and  any
            additional switches desired to the MOUNT command.

        5.  When MOUNTR replies with  the  Tape  Mount  Request  and  the
            acknowledgement  of  the  unlabeled tape being mounted, press
            <RET> and type POP to return to OPR.

        6.  If you are using an unlabeled tape, give the IDENTIFY command
            to OPR to identify the tape drive for the mount request.


                                    7-32
                         UNSCHEDULED SOFTWARE TASKS                         UNSCHEDULED SOFTWARE TASKS


        7.  When MOUNTR replies with Tape Drive Given To Request  number,
            type PUSH to OPR.

        8.  After the system has displayed the defined tape drive for the
            setname:, type DUMPER.

        9.  Type to DUMPER:

            TAPE MTn:<RET>

                 LIST/MAIL filespec
                 MIGRATE str:<directory>filespec (for Migration)
                 MAIL filespec

       10.  DUMPER asks you two questions.  If the tape  has  never  been
            used  before  for  migration,  you  should answer YES to both
            questions.  If the tape has been used before  for  migration,
            you  should  answer  NO  to the first question and the second
            question does not appear (see the example below).

       11.  When DUMPER replies with the following messages:

                 TOTAL FILES dumped = nn
                 TOTAL Pages dumped = nn

            Type EXIT to DUMPER.

       12.  Type DISMOUNT MTn:

       13.  Physically remove the tape from the tape drive.

       14.  Mount and ready the second tape for the migration and  repeat
            Steps  4 through 12.  The migration of files is now complete,
            and those users who had files migrated receive a  message  in
            their MAIL.TXT files indicating the files that were migrated.
            If files in your directory were  migrated,  you  receive  the
            same message.

       15.  Type POP to return to OPR.

                            ----- Example -----

   The following is an example of the DUMPER program  that  was  used  to
   migrate  files.   It  is  assumed  that  you  have  already  mounted a
   unlabeled tape on MTA1:  and the tape(s) have never been  used  before
   for migration.

   7.9  RETRIEVING FILES WITH DUMPER   7.9  RETRIEVING FILES WITH DUMPER

   Once a file is migrated or archived, the user cannot modify that  file
   unless  he  retrieves  the file with the TOPS-20 RETRIEVE command.  If
   the user wants to modify an archived file, he must first retrieve  the
   file  and then discard the tape archive status from the FDB.  When the
   user gives the RETRIEVE  command,  OPR  responds  with  the  following
   message:

        hh:mm:ss        File Retrieval n  --Retrieval Request--
                        str:<directory>filespec

   where n is the processor number processing the  request,  str: is  the
   requested   structure   name,  <directory>  is  the  requested  user's
   directory name, and filespec is the file specification.

   When a retrieval request is initially queued by a user, the request is
   stored  in  a  request  queue maintained by the system.  All retrieval
   requests are kept in the queue in order by the  archived  or  migrated
   tape   information.    This   information   consists   of  the  volume
   identification, the tape saveset number, and  the  tape  file  number.
   When each additional request is received by the system, the request is
   inserted in the proper sorted position within the queue.  Ordering the
   retrieval requests in this way reduces the amount of tape mounting and
   dismounting that must be performed by  you  when  you  run  DUMPER  to
   retrieve the requested files.

   To retrieve requested files with DUMPER, you must do the following:

        1.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        2.  Type ENABLE.

        3.  Run DUMPER and type:

            RETRIEVE str:<directory>filespec

        4.  When MOUNTR replies with  a  Tape  Mount  Request,  you  must
            physically   locate,  mount,  and  ready  the  tape  for  the
            retrieval.  MOUNTR obtains  the  tape  volid  from  the  file
            descriptor block (FDB) of each file requested for retrieval.

        5.  When MOUNTR replies that the tape is  mounted,  press  CTRL/C
            twice and then type POP to return to OPR.

        6.  If the label type is UNLABELED, give the IDENTIFY command  to
            OPR to identify the tape to MOUNTR.

        7.  After MOUNTR has displayed that the tape has  been  given  to
            the request number, type PUSH to OPR.

        8.  Type CONTINUE to return to the DUMPER program.

        9.  DUMPER then retrieves the files automatically and lists  them
            on your console.

       10.  When  the  retrievals  are  completed,  DUMPER  automatically
            unloads  the  tape.   If the retrievals require more than one
            tape,  DUMPER  unloads  and  requests  the  additional  tapes
            automatically.   Each  tape mount request has to be given the
            IDENTIFY  command  at  OPR  command  level.   You   have   to
            physically remove and mount each tape.

       11.  Type EXIT to DUMPER.

       12.  Type POP to return to OPR.

   The filespec (str:<directory>filespec)  in  the  RETRIEVE  command  is
   referred  to as the "file group descriptor".  This is because the file
   group descriptor can be one file specification  or  a  group  of  file
   specifications with or without the use of wildcard characters.

   When DUMPER retrieves file(s), retrieval requests in the request queue
   can be requeued for one of two reasons:

        1.  The   request    does    not    fall    within    the    path
            (str:<directory>filespec)  specified  by  you  in  the DUMPER
            RETRIEVE command.

        2.  The request called for a tape that had data errors on  it  or
            could not be mounted.

   Requests that are requeued have their time stamp zeroed out,  so  that
   DUMPER  reconsiders  the  request during the same retrieval operation.
   When all requests have been retrieved and there are no new requests to
   be  considered,  the  system informs DUMPER that the request queue has
   been exhausted.

                                  WARNING

           If there are no files in the retrieval queue  and  you
           give  the RETRIEVE command to DUMPER, DUMPER waits for
           approximately  5  minutes.   DUMPER  then  aborts  the
           RETRIEVAL request and sends the message:

                ?Assuming no requests in the retrieval queue.

           Before running DUMPER to retrieve  files,  you  should
           give the SHOW QUEUES RETRIEVAL-REQUESTS/ALL command to
           OPR to see if any retrievals have been requested.  The
           /ALL   switch  allows  you  to  see  the  entire  file
           specification.

   If you are unable to locate the requested  tape  volume  or  the  tape
   volume is bad, perform the following steps:

        1.  Type CTRL/C twice and type POP to return to OPR.

        2.  Type CANCEL MOUNT-REQUEST nn (where nn is the  mount  request
            number).

        3.  Type PUSH and then type CONTINUE to return to DUMPER.

        4.  DUMPER displays the following message:

            ?Cannot mount tape, Mount refused by operator
            Try again?

        5.  Type NO, and DUMPER replies with:

            Should I ask about this tape anymore during this run?

            If you answer no, other requests for the  tape  are  ignored.
            If  you  answer  yes,  additional  requests  for the tape are
            processed.

        6.  DUMPER then requests the next retrieval tape to be mounted.

        7.  You can then follow Steps 5 through 12 on the previous pages.

   7.10  RESTORING DISK FILES WITH DUMPER   7.10  RESTORING DISK FILES WITH DUMPER

   If a user requests that you restore some files for him from a magnetic
   tape, be sure to find out:

        1.  What magnetic tape(s) to use.  You might have to use  a  tape
            containing a complete SAVE and some tapes from an INCREMENTAL
            SAVE.  You or the  user  should  look  through  the  terminal
            output kept for each DUMPER SAVE and determine which tapes to
            use.

        2.  What files to restore and what directory they are in.

        3.  What directory to put them into.

        4.  What special DUMPER status commands to use, if any.  (See the
            _______  ____  _________  _____            TOPS-20  User  Utilities  Guide  for details on DUMPER status
            commands.)

        5.  What version of DUMPER is being used.  Dumper may not restore
            passwords correctly if you use an incorrect version of DUMPER
                       _______  ____  _________  ______            (see  the  TOPS-20  User  Utilities  Manual  for  details  on
            password encryption.)

                                    NOTE

           DUMPER does not work on a 7-track magnetic tape  drive
           (TU71).

   Then do the following:

        1.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        2.  Type ENABLE.

        3.  Type MOUNT TAPE setname:  with the /LABEL TYPE:  switch,  the
            /VOLIDS:   switch,  and the /NOWAIT switch.  The default mode
            is READ-ONLY.

        4.  If you are connected to another  structure,  CONNECT  to  the
            structure for the restore.

        5.  When MOUNTR replies with  the  Tape  Mount  Request  and  the
            acknowledgement  of  the  unlabeled tape being mounted, press
            <RET> and type POP to return to OPR.

        6.  If the label type is unlabeled, give the IDENTIFY command  to
            OPR to identify the tape drive to the mount request.

        7.  If the desired structure is not mounted for the restore, type
            PUSH to OPR, then give the command MOUNT STRUCTURE str:.

        8.  When the system replies with  Tape  Drive  Given  To  Request
            number  (and  the structure is mounted), and after the system
            has displayed the message that defines the tape drive for the
            setname:, type DUMPER.

        9.  Type the following DUMPER commands.

            TAPE MTn:<RET>
            RESTORE str:<directory>filespec<RET>

            (See argument types for  filespecs  below  or  refer  to  the
                                   _______ ____ _________ _____            RESTORE command in the TOPS-20 User Utilities Guide.)

       10.  When DUMPER prompts again, type EXIT.

       11.  Type DISMOUNT TAPE MTn:.

       12.  Type DISABLE.

       13.  Type POP to return to OPR.

       14.  Remove the magnetic tape from the drive.

   Argument types for RESTORE:

        1.  To restore an entire user area, for example, to copy all  the
            files  of directory PS:<DIR> on tape to directory PS:<DIR> on
            disk:

            RESTORE PS:<DIR><RET>

        2.  To restore certain files on directory  PS:<DIR>  on  tape  to
            directory PS:<DIR> on disk:

            RESTORE PS:<DIR>file1,PS:<DIR>file2,...<RET>

        3.  To restore PS:<A>A.MAC to PS:<SOURCE>A.MAS and PS:<B>X.MAC to

   In addition, you can specify either of two  optional  switches  before
   the file group descriptor.  These switches are as follows:

        1.  /NOTAPE-INFORMATION - specifies that no archive or  migration
            tape  information  is restored with the file(s).  This switch
            can be used when a  user  wishes  to  transfer  a  file  from
            another  system  to  his  disk  area  on  your  system.   The
            /NOTAPE-INFORMATION switch avoids bringing  tape  information
            from another system.

        2.  /TAPE-INFORMATION  -  specifies  that  tape  information   is
            restored  with  the  file(s).  This switch can be used when a
            user wishes to restore a file that was migrated  or  archived
            and  then  inadvertently  deleted  and expunged from his disk
            area.

   If you do not specify either switch, /TAPE-INFORMATION is the default.

                              ----- Hint -----

   If the user's files on the DUMPER tape(s) have  accounts  not  in  the
   installed ACCOUNTS-TABLE.BIN file, do the following:

        1.  Log in as the user who requested  the  file  restoration  and
            specif a valid account for that user.

        2.  Follow Steps 3 through 9 in the procedure above, and type the
            DUMPER command:

                 ACCOUNT SYSTEM-DEFAULT<RET>

            before the RESTORE command to DUMPER.

        3.  Type LOGOUT.

   7.11  ANSWERING STRUCTURE MOUNT REQUESTS WITH OPR   7.11  ANSWERING STRUCTURE MOUNT REQUESTS WITH OPR

   When a user issues a request to mount or dismount a structure with the
   TOPS-20  MOUNT  or  DISMOUNT command, ORION passes a message to OPR to
   inform you of  the  request.   You  can  then  respond  by  physically
   mounting  or dismounting the structure.  When the system receives this
   request, it has OPR  print  the  following  message  on  the  terminal
   running OPR:

        OPR>
        hh:mm:ss          --Structure Mount Request #nn--
        Mount str: (alias ptr:)
        User username, job nn, Terminal nn

        (List of available drives)

   where:

        hh:mm:ss         specifies the time  the  operator  received  the
                         message.

        Request#nn       specifies the request  number  assigned  to  the
                         mount request.

        Mount str:       specifies the physical name of the structure.

        User username    specifies the name of the user  who  issued  the
                         MOUNT request.

        Job nn,          specifies the job number the user  was  assigned
                         when he logged onto the system.

        Terminal nn      specifies the line number of the  terminal  from
                         which the user issued the MOUNT request.

        FREE DRIVES      specifies the disk drives that are available.

   The list of available disk drives contains those drives that meet  one
   of the following conditions:

        1.  The drive is off-line.

        2.  The drive has a nonrecognizable structure on it.




                                    7-47

        3.  The drive is on-line, it has a recognizable structure on  it,
            no  user  has MOUNTed it, no user has CONNECTed to it, and no
            user has a file open on it.

   The list also provides the following information:

        1.  The type of drive (RP04, RP06, RP07, RP20, RA60, or RA81).

        2.  The channel number of the drive.

        3.  The controller number of the drive.

        4.  The physical unit number of the drive.

        5.  The state of the drive (available/unavailable).

        6.  The mount status of the drive.

        7.  The mount count.

        8.  The structure name on the drive.

        9.  The attributes of the structure.

   You reply to a MOUNT request by doing the following:

        1.  Mount all the packs of the structure requested on any of  the
            available   drives  in  the  list.   MOUNTR  then  makes  the
            structure known to the system  and  cancels  the  outstanding
            message.

            Once the structure is known  by  the  system,  OPR  prints  a
            message similar to:

            OPR>
            hh:mm:ss          --STRUCTURE MOUNTED--
                            Structure str: (Alias:name) mounted
            OPR>

            But if the request was for a structure to  be  mounted  on  a
            remote CFS-20 node, OPR prints the following:

            12:01:10     Received Message From (remote system name)::
            11:59:00     -- Mount request by operator completed --
                  Structure (structure name): mounted as alias (alias name):


            OPR  prints  the  preceding  messages  only  after  you  have
            physically mounted all the packs in the structure.

                             ----- Hints -----

   OPR continues to handle other requests from other users, if you do not
   respond  to  a  MOUNT  request with some action.  For example, if five
   separate users request five different structure  MOUNTs  at  the  same
   time, you can respond individually to each request in any order.

   Sometimes you see a message similar to:

        OPR>
        13:02:15          --STRUCTURE MOUNTED--
                        Structure PS: (Alias:DIAG) mounted
        OPR>

   without seeing a MOUNT request.  This happens when a user does a MOUNT
   for  a  structure  that  the  system  found  on-line.  This is just an
   informational message for you; it requires no action.
                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  In this example, a user wanted to MOUNT a structure  that  is
            unavailable.   When  this  message  appears  on your console,
            CANCEL the MOUNT-REQUEST and give a reason.

   7.11.1  Mounting a Structure with MOUNT   7.11.1  Mounting a Structure with MOUNT

   If you need to mount a structure, other than the structures  that  are
   normally  mounted  at  system  start-up, you can give either the MOUNT
   command at TOPS-20 command level or give  the  MOUNT  command  at  OPR
   command  level.   For  example, to mount a structure called SNARK, you
   would give the following command:

         _____ _________ ___________        @MOUNT STRUCTURE SNARK:<RET>

   In a CFS-20 cluster that has cluster GALAXY enabled, you can  mount  a
   structure  on  a system by issuing the MOUNT command from any terminal
   in the cluster.  You do not have to use a terminal on the system where
   the  structure is to be mounted.  For example, you can issue a command
   from node SYSA::  that will cause a structure to be  mounted  on  node
   SYSB::.  To do this, you would give the following command from SYSA:

       _____ _________ ______________________________   OPR>MOUNT STRUCTURE DATA:/CLUSTER-NODE:SYSB::<RET>



                                    7-50

   If the structure you want to mount has the same  physical  name  as  a
   structure  that  is already mounted, you must assign an alias name for
   the structure you want to mount.  The alias name is placed  after  the
   word STRUCTURE followed by the /STRUCTURE-ID switch and actual name of
   the structure.  You must have WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges enabled  to
   perform  this  task.   For  example,  to specify an alias name for the
   structure SNARK:  you would give the following command:

         _____ _________ ______  _____________ ___________        $MOUNT STRUCTURE CHECK:  /STRUCTURE-ID SNARK:<RET>

   In the above command you have mounted a structure  with  the  physical
   name  SNARK:  and the alias name CHECK:.  Any user wishing to use this
   structure has to refer to it by the structure name CHECK:.

   If a disk drive containing a structure, other than BS:  or PS:, starts
   to  have hardware problems, you can remove the structure from the disk
   drive.  You must move the structure to an available drive of the  same
   type  but you do not have to give a DISMOUNT command.  If there are no
   available disk drives, and the structure you are moving  is  necessary
   for  normal  system  operation, you must first DISMOUNT a structure on
   another disk drive of the same  type  and  then  MOUNT  the  necessary
   structure on that drive.

                                    NOTE

           When you assign an alias  name  to  a  structure,  the
           physical  name  of  the structure (which is written in
           the home blocks of the  structure)  does  not  change.
                          _______ ______ _________ _____           Refer  to  the TOPS-20 System Manager's Guide for more
           information on alias names.

                            ----- Example -----

   A user from another installation wants to mount his  public  structure
   on  your  system.  Because you already have a public structure on your
   system, you must assign his structure an alias.

   when  the  system recognizes the structure as mounted and on-line, the
   following message appears on your terminal:

        Structure CHECK: mounted

   On the terminal running OPR, the following message is displayed.

                                  WARNING

           If the system goes down  while  a  structure  with  an
           alias  name  is mounted, you should put the disk drive
           that the structure with  the  alias  name  is  mounted
           off-line  prior  to restarting the system.  The reason
           for this is that when the  system  is  restarted,  the
           monitor  looks  at  the physical name of the structure
           rather than the  alias  name  and  reports  errors  of
           duplicate  structures  mounted.   After the system has
           restarted, bring the disk drive back on-line and mount
           the structure again with an alias name.

   7.11.3  Removing a Structure with DISMOUNT   7.11.3  Removing a Structure with DISMOUNT

   If you need to remove a structure from the  system  (perhaps  to  have
   maintenance done on a drive, to run CHECKD on a structure, or to mount
   another structure), perform the  following  procedures  in  the  order
   given below:

        1.  Whenever OPR outputs a list of packs for  removal,  check  if
            the  structure  you want to remove is in the list.  If it is,
            you can remove all the packs  in  the  structure  before  you
            respond  to  the  current  OPR  request.  If it is not in the
            list, go to Step 2.

        2.  If the structure does not appear in the  available  list,  do
            the following with OPR commands:

            a.  Type a SET STRUCTURE str: UNAVAILABLE, so  that  no  user
                can MOUNT the structure and no batch or print request can
                be scheduled for that structure.

            b.  If you intend to run CHECKD on the structure,  also  type
                SET STRUCTURE str: IGNORED.

            c.  Type a SEND ALL message to notify all users  to  DISMOUNT
                the structure by a certain time.

            d.  If you want to remove the  structure  from  the  drive(s)
                after the time is up, type DISMOUNT STRUCTURE str: (with)
                REMOVAL.  However, to run CHECKD on the structure, follow
                Step 3, a.  through d.  and then type CHECKD.

            e.  If OPR outputs the structure name in the  list  of  packs
                available  for  removal,  immediately set one pack of the
                structure off-line.  Otherwise, go to Step 3.

            f.  Remove the packs of the structure  from  the  drives  you
                need.

        3.  If the structure  does  not  appear  in  the  list  (item  1.
            above), you can forcibly dismount the structure by taking the
            following steps.

            a.  Type SHOW STATUS STRUCTURE str name:.

            b.  Type SEND ALL to give those users of the structure a last
                warning to DISMOUNT the structure.

            c.  Type SET STRUCTURE str: UNAVAILABLE.

            d.  Type DISMOUNT STRUCTURE str: (with) REMOVAL.

            e.  Because the structure now appears in the  OPR  output  of
                packs  available  for  removal,  remove  the packs of the
                structure from the drives you need.

   When you want OPR to mount a structure that has been set IGNORED,  set
   the structure to be ACKNOWLEDGED.

                            ----- Example -----

   For example, if you want to remove a structure XYZ from the system  by
   4  P.M.,  and  there are currently users of the structure, declare the
   structure UNAVAILABLE about ten minutes before 4 P.M.  Then warn users
   to DISMOUNT XYZ.

   ______ ______________   CFS-20 Configurations

   In a CFS-20 configuration, structures can be set EXCLUSIVE for use  by
   one  system  or  SHARED for use by all systems.  You do this by typing
   the following OPR> commands:

        SET STRUCTURE str name: EXCLUSIVE<RET>

             or

        SET STRUCTURE str name: SHARED<RET>

   If you then need to dismount and remove  a  structure  from  a  CFS-20
   configuration, perform the following steps in the order given below:

        1.  If the structure is set  EXCLUSIVE,  perform  steps  1  to  3
            listed  above  and add REMOVAL to the DISMOUNT STRUCTURE str:
            command.

        2.  If the structure is set SHARED, perform the following steps:

            a.  Type the SEND ALL /CLUSTER-NODE:* command to  notify  all
                users  on  all  nodes  in  the  cluster  to  DISMOUNT the
                structure by a certain time.

            b.  Type DISMOUNT STRUCTURE  str:   (with)  REMOVAL  on  your
                system.

            c.  Remove the structure from the system.


   Refer to Example 3 for details on the Step 2 procedure.

                                    NOTE

           If the optional argument,  REMOVAL  or  NOREMOVAL,  is
           omitted,  the  structure  will default to removal on a
           non-CFS-20 system and non-removal on a CFS-20 system.


   Step 2 above ensures that the structure is set for  exclusive  use  by
   one  system  before  it  can be removed.  If there are problems during
   this automatic procedure, you may receive any  one  of  the  following
   messages:

        1.  
            12:01:00        -- Dismount error --

                    Structure FOO: is locked by node GIDNEY:
                    Dismount request failed.

            This error occurs if MOUNTR  cannot  obtain  a  lock  on  the
            structure  through  the  ENQ% monitor call.  (See your system
            programmer or manager for details.)

            This message indicates that the structure is mounted  on  the
            indicated  nodes, but the nodes are not accessible to cluster
            GALAXY or do not have  the  cluster  GALAXY  option  enabled.
            Therefore,   the   DISMOUNT  (with)  REMOVAL  command  cannot
            automatically dismount the structure remotely.  So  you  must
            log  into  the  nodes  indicated  and  dismount the structure
            yourself with NO-REMOVAL.

   7.12  SETTING THE PORT CI AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE   7.12  SETTING THE PORT CI AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE

   If your installation uses the CI for HSC50 disks or CFS, the  CI  port
   is AVAILABLE by default.  There may be times, however, when the system
   manager determines that the CI port must be set UNAVAILABLE.   Setting
   the  CI port UNAVAILABLE ends the system's use of the CI and any disks
   that use the CI.

   Most often, the CI port is set UNAVAILABLE when  there  is  a  serious
   hardware  problem  and it is necessary to run CI diagnostics.  Setting
   the CI port UNAVAILABLE is not a standard procedure and should not  be
   performed without approval from the system manager.

   To set the CI port UNAVAILABLE, perform the following steps:

        1.  Type SET PORT CI UNAVAILABLE <RET>.

        2.  Once you see the message that indicates which structures  are
            affected,  send  a system message telling users when you plan
            to set the CI  port  UNAVAILABLE  and  which  structures  are
            affected.

        3.  Respond  to  the  message  indicating  which  structures  are
            affected  by  typing RESPOND <RESPONSE NUMBER> and one of the
            following:

            PROCEED - The  PROCEED  response  begins  the  SET  PORT   CI
            UNAVAILABLE  procedure.  PROCEED is the standard response for
            setting the CI port UNAVAILABLE.

            FORCE - The FORCE response dismounts all structures and  sets
            the   CI   UNAVAILABLE   with  no  further  operator  action.
            Structures are dismounted whether or not they are in use.

            ABORT - The  ABORT  response  cancels   the   SET   PORT   CI
            UNAVAILABLE  procedure.   If  the  SET  PORT  CI  UNAVAILABLE
            procedure is aborted at this time, system  operation  is  not
            changed.

   Each structure and disk-drive is now handled on an  individual  basis.
   Depending on the message you see, do one of the following:

        4.  If a structure is on a dual-ported disk-drive:

            a.  You receive  a  message  indicating  that  the  drive  is
                dual-ported.   Respond to the message by setting the port
                switch to a single port following procedures listed below
                and then type one of the following:

                1.  Spin down the pack.

                2.  Set the port switch to either A or B appropriately.

                3.  Spin up the pack.

                PROCEED - The PROCEED reponse  indicates  that  the  port
                switch is set to one system and is no longer dual-ported.
                The process of setting the CI port UNAVAILABLE continues.
                You  DISMOUNT  any mounted structure by responding to the
                request for DISMOUNT.

                FORCE - The FORCE response indicates that the  status  of
                the disk drive should be ignored.  The port switch is not
                changed but the process of  setting  the  CI  UNAVAILABLE
                continues.   Use  caution  with  this  response.  CFS may
                disallow use of a dual-ported disk if the FORCE  response
                is given.  Any MOUNTed structure is DISMOUNTed.

                ABORT - The ABORT  response  terminates  the  process  of
                setting  the  CI  port UNAVAILABLE.  All previous actions
                remain, but the CI port remains AVAILABLE.

        5.  If the structure is mounted on a disk drive connected to  the
            CI:

            You have to DISMOUNT the structure.  DISMOUNT  the  structure
                                    7-64

            by responding to the request for DISMOUNT.

        6.  If the structure is not connected to a drive on the CI and is
            not dual-ported:

            The structure is  set  EXCLUSIVE  to  your  system.   If  the
            structure  cannot  be  set  EXCLUSIVE  by the system, you are
            prompted for an action.  You have to DISMOUNT  the  structure
            (with) NO REMOVAL from the other systems before the structure
            is set EXCLUSIVE to your system.

        7.  When all structures mounted on CI disks are  dismounted,  all
            dual-ported disk drives set, and necessary structures are set
            EXCLUSIVE, you see a message indicating that the CI  port  is
            set UNAVAILABLE.

        8.  The CI port  remains  UNAVAILABLE  until  you  set  the  port
            AVAILABLE.

        9.  If at any point during the process, you refuse to dismount  a
            structure or handle a dual-ported disk drive, the SET PORT CI
            UNAVAILABLE procedure is aborted.  All previously  dismounted
            structures   remain   dismounted  but  the  CI  port  remains
            AVAILABLE.

                                   NOTES


           1.  At  any  point  during  the  procedure,  you   can
               dismount  all  structures  at  one  time using the
               DISMOUNT procedures in Section  7.11.3.   In  this
               case,  when  you  type  PROCEED during the CI port
               procedure, you are prompted  only  for  structures
               that have been overlooked.

           2.  At any point during the procedure, you can set all
               drives  that  are  dual-ported  to  a single port.
               When  you  type  PROCEED  during   the   CI   port
               procedure,  you  are only prompted for drives that
               have been overlooked.

           3.  If you type the SET PORT  CI  UNAVAILABLE  command
               and  your  installation  does  not  have a CI, you
               receive an error message.

   If  your  installation  is  using  the  NI  port  for  the   DECnet-20
   connection, the NI is set available by default.  However, there may be
   times when  you  need  to  diagnose  the  NI  or  use  the  system  in
   stand-alone mode.  Setting the NI port UNAVAILABLE disables the DECNET
   connection.

   7.13  EXAMINING MOUNT-REQUESTS IN THE QUEUE   7.13  EXAMINING MOUNT-REQUESTS IN THE QUEUE

   Whenever a user submits a request  for  a  tape  or  disk  mount,  the
   request  is  placed  in  a  queue  where it waits for your response to
   either mount the tape or disk or delete the mount request.  To examine
   the  tape  and disk mount queue at any time, give the OPR command SHOW
   QUEUES MOUNT-REQUESTS.

   The output of the SHOW QUEUES MOUNT-REQUESTS command displays:

        1.  The name of the tape or disk volume

        2.  The status of the request

        3.  The type of request (Tape or Disk)

        4.  The density of the request

        5.  The write access requested

        6.  The number of the request

        7.  The number of the user's job who made the request

        8.  The name of the user

        9.  The label status of a tape (labeled or unlabeled)

   The status column displays the following:

        1.  Waiting, if a tape or disk request is waiting to be satisfied

        2.  A tape drive name (for example, MTA3:),  if  the  request  is
            currently for a tape drive

        3.  Dismount, if a tape or disk is being dismounted

        4.  Aborted, if a tape mount request has been deleted or  aborted
            and  the user has not yet given a dismount command to release
            the logical tape drive (MTn:)

   If you specified the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch, the display also includes
   the  name of the remote CFS-20 node and the times that the remote node
   processed the command and the local system received the information.

   7.14  CREATING A STRUCTURE DURING TIMESHARING   7.14  CREATING A STRUCTURE DURING TIMESHARING

   During timesharing, you can create a structure by doing the following:

        1.  Obtain the number of formatted  disk  packs  needed  for  the
            structure.

        2.  Place the packs on any available  disk  drives  and  put  the
            drives on-line.

        3.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        4.  Run CHECKD.

        5.  Type CREATE structure name to CHECKD.

        6.  Answer the questions from CHECKD.

        7.  Type EXIT to CHECKD.

        8.  MOUNT STRUCTURE str:

   If this structure is to be used on a system other than a KL10 Model B,
   perform steps 9 through 11.  Otherwise, proceed at step 12.

        9.  Run CHECKD.

       10.  Type DISABLE LARGE-DIRECTORIES




                                    7-77

       11.  Type EXIT to CHECKD.

       12.  Type DISABLE.

       13.  Type POP to return to OPR command level.

   If CHECKD is a subjob of PTYCON at your installation, you need only to
   CONNECT  to the CHECKD subjob and perform Steps 5 through 8 above.  If
   your installation is part of a CFS-20 configuration, CHECKD may not be
   able  to  set  the  structure  exclusive.   If  this happens, you must
   dismount the structure from the  other  systems  using  it.   Use  the
   dismount  procedures  for  CFS-20  systems  in  Section  7.11.3.  Then
   reissue the CHECKD command.

                                    NOTE

           When  you  create  a  structure,   you   destroy   any
           information  that  was previously on the disk packs in
           the structure.  If you want to  save  any  information
           from  an  old  structure, run DUMPER to save the files
           before you create the new structure on the  same  disk
           packs.

   When you are running CHECKD to create  a  structure,  first  type  the
   CREATE  command  and  specify  the  name  of the structure you want to
   create.  This  name  is  a  physical  identification  written  on  the
   structure by CHECKD.

   CHECKD then asks a series of questions.  For  each  question  you  can
   type ?  to get a help message.  The questions are:

   ENTER ALIAS:

        Type a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric name for the alias.  If you
        do  not type a number, or if a structure has the same name as the
        structure you are creating, type the structure name as the alias.
        If another structure of the same name is mounted, press RETURN to
        get the default alias, CHECKD.  If another structure  is  mounted
        with the name CHECKD, use another name.  The alias is a temporary
        name that the system uses for your structure.

   HOW MANY UNITS IN THIS STRUCTURE?

        Type the number of disk packs that will be in the structure.

   DECIMAL channel, CONTROLLER AND UNIT numbers FOR LOGICAL UNIT n:

        This question is asked for each unit n in the structure.  Type in
        a  decimal  channel  number,  followed by a comma, the controller
        number followed by a comma, and  a  unit  (or  drive)  number  to
        indicate where unit n is mounted.

        The help message for this question is similar to:

        Triple of decimal numbers from one of the following:

        TYPE  CHANNEL  CONTROLLER   UNIT   STRUCTURE NAME  LOGICAL UNIT
        ----  -------  ----------   ----   --------------  ------------ 
        RP06        1      -1          0   OFF-LINE
        RP06        1      -1          1   OFF-LINE
        RP04        1      -1          2   STR2            0 (1 OF 1)
        RP06        1      -1          5   OFF-LINE

        This output lists each drive that is available.  Thus, each  disk
        pack  for the structure you are creating must be on some drive in
        the list.  A structure name appears in the list if a disk pack is
        on-line and was formerly part of a structure.  Do not specify the
        drive for that pack if you still want data from that structure.

        If the help message does not eliminate confusion over channel and
        drive   correspondence,   consult   your  DIGITAL  Field  Service
        Representative.
   NUMBER OF PAGES TO ALLOCATE FOR SWAPPING?

        Type 0 if the structure is never going to be used as  the  system
        structure,  BS:.   Press ESCape to set the default value.  Type a
        decimal number between 2000 and 40000 to specify a number.

        If you have any question about the amount of swapping space,  see
        your  system manager.  Note that swapping space is necessary on a
        system structure, but the default value  is  usually  sufficient.
        If  past  experience  has shown many SWAPPING SPACE LOW messages,
        you may need more swapping space.  Increasing the swapping  space
        here,  however,  may  not  be  sufficient,  because  the  maximum
        swapping space allocated within  the  monitor  takes  precedence.
        Thus, you might need a larger monitor or a tailored monitor.

   NUMBER OF PAGES TO ALLOCATE FOR THE FRONT END FILE SYSTEM?

        Type 0 if the structure  is  never  to  be  used  as  the  system
        structure,  BS:.   Press  ESCape  to get the default; the default
        should always be sufficient for the front-end file system.

   OWNER NAME?

        Type a 1- to 12-character alphanumeric name for the owner of  the
        structure.

   IS THIS A SYSTEM STRUCTURE FOR STARTUP?

        If this structure is to be used for  system  startup,  type  YES.
        Otherwise, type NO.

                The  following  question  only  appears  if   you
                answered YES to the above question.

   SERIAL NUMBER OF CPU STARTED FROM THIS STRUCTURE?

        Enter the serial number of the system this structure will be used
        on.

   When CHECKD finishes the CREATE function, it prompts again.  When  you
   are finished with CHECKD, type EXIT.

   In the following example, structure QWERTY  is  created  as  a  1-pack

   7.15  COMMUNICATING WITH USERS   7.15  COMMUNICATING WITH USERS

   Timesharing and batch users often need  to  communicate  with  you  to
   perform  various  tasks,  to  obtain  help,  or to send messages.  The
   following sections tell you how to:

        1.  Respond to PLEASE requests with OPR

        2.  Help another user with SEND

        3.  Mail a message to a user with MAIL

        4.  Read any messages sent to you with RDMAIL

                     _______________ __________ ______   Refer also to the TOPS-10/TOPS-20 DECmail/MS Manual for information on
   the DECmail/MS system.  You can use it in place of MAIL and RDMAIL for
   sending and receiving mail.



   7.15.1  Answering PLEASE Requests with OPR   7.15.1  Answering PLEASE Requests with OPR

   When a user sends a message  with  PLEASE,  you  receive  from  OPR  a
   message at the console terminal that is time-stamped and has a message
   number enclosed in angle brackets.  You should then answer the request
   with the RESPOND command in OPR.  If you are not at OPR command level,
   you must connect to the subjob running OPR  in  PTYCON  to  issue  the
   RESPOND command.

   If the user requested some form of physical action, such  as  changing


                                    7-81

   the  forms  on  the  line  printer,  you  can make the change and then
   respond to let the user know that the change has been made.   You  can
   type  any response to this message.  However, you should pay attention
   to what the user said in the line of text and try to do what the  user
   requested.   If  further  communication  is necessary, you can use the
   TALK command, the MAIL program, or issue the SEND command in OPR.   If
   the request cannot be satisfied, you can respond with a refusal and/or
   text to explain why the request cannot be satisfied.

   The format of the request from the user appears as follows:

        hh:mm:ss    <n>    --Message from Timesharing User--
                         Job number User at Terminal nnn
                         one or more lines of text (or)
                         PLEASE line of text

   This request contains the word PLEASE if  the  user  sent  a  one-line
   message  with  the  PLEASE  program,  or the line contains one or more
   lines of text ending with a ^Z (Control Z).  This  message  can  be  a
   request  for action, a question, or a comment.  The user who sends you
   a PLEASE message should include a word or two for you  to  include  in
   the  RESPOND command to indicate that the request or question has been
   completed.  If the user does not include any word(s) for  the  RESPOND
   command,  you  can  RESPOND  in any way desired to answer the message.
   With some requests, this line  might  be  repeated  to  allow  you  to
   respond with different words for different circumstances.
                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  A user might ask when timesharing ends.  The message  appears
            as follows:

            OPR>
            12:32:09    <3>    --Message from Timesharing User--

                             PLEASE WHEN WILL TIMESHARING END?
                             RESPOND HH:MM:SS
            OPR>

            And, you can respond as follows:

   7.15.2  Talking to Another User Immediately with SEND   7.15.2  Talking to Another User Immediately with SEND

   If a user indicates that help is needed from you to  use  some  system
   feature,  you can help the user with the OPR command SEND.  Connect to
   OPR from PTYCON and then give either of the following commands:

            ____ ___ _ ____________        OPR>SEND JOB n message<RET>

   or

            ____ ________ _ ____________        OPR>SEND TERMINAL n message<RET>

   where n is the number of the timesharing or batch  job  in  the  first
   command above, or the number of the user's terminal line in the second
   command above.

   The SEND command allows you the option of including the message either
   in  the  SEND  command  string  or  as  multiple lines terminated by a
   CTRL/Z.

   The SEND command does not link your job or terminal to the user's  job
   or  terminal.   If  the  user  is  waiting for input to a program, the
   message sent appears on the user's terminal, but it  does  not  affect
   the program he is running.

   If you want to follow TO:  or CC:  with  a  list  of  users,  separate
   their names with commas.  You can also specify one indirect file which
   contains a list of names separated by commas.  Precede the  file  name
   with "@", but be sure you put it last in the list.  For example:

            ___________________________        TO: SMITH,JONES,@LISTA.USR<RET>

   sends a message to SMITH,  JONES,  and  all  the  users  in  the  file
   LISTA.USR.   You  can  use recognition input on the user names and the
   filename.

   You can also use one indirect file for the  message  itself.   Precede
   the  filename  which  contains the message with "@" and follow it with
   CTRL/Z or <RET>.  You can use recognition on the filename.

   If you are notified by a user that his terminal is not responding, try
   the following:

        1.  Check the terminal speed.  Ask  the  user  for  his  terminal
            number,  or  if  the  user  is logged in, do a SYSTAT user to
            determine  the  terminal  number.    Then   type   the   file
            SYSTEM:n-CONFIG.CMD,  where  n is the TOPS-20 version number.
            Find the line referring to the terminal number and  see  what
            its  initial  speed should be.  If the terminal is designated
            for autobaud detection, the speed is 110, 150, 300, or  1200.
            Have  the user manually set the terminal for the proper speed

        2.  If Step 1 does not work, be sure the user leaves the terminal
            set  at  the  speed specified in the n-CONFIG.CMD file.  Then

            have the user try again.

            terminal  for  the  speed  in  the  n-CONFIG.CMD file, give a
            ^ESET TERMINAL command as above for a speed  which  the  user
            can  manually  set  for the terminal.  Then have the user try
            again.  If that succeeds and the terminal is going to be used
            permanently,     you    should    also    edit    the    file
            SYSTEM:n-CONFIG.CMD to change the speed for that terminal.

        4.  If none of the above works, the terminal is broken or the job
            is  hung.  Notify the user of his options, given below.  Then
            notify your system manager and software specialist.

   If a terminal is not functioning correctly or a job is hung, the  user
   has the following options:

        1.  If he is not logged in, the user can simply look for  another
            terminal and log in.

        2.  If the user is logged in and  wants  the  same  job,  try  to
            unattach the user's job.  Type to OPR:

            where name is the user's name and n is the user's job number.

            The user should then try  to  attach  to  job  n  at  another
            terminal.  If the user is still unsuccessful, go to Step 3.

        3.  If the user is logged in, try to log the job out by typing to
            OPR:

            where n is the user's job number.   (Section  7.17  has  more
            detail  on  logging out a job.) If LOGOUT succeeds within ten
            seconds and the terminal is functioning correctly,  the  user
            should  then  be  able to log in at the same terminal.  If it
            does not succeed, go to Step 4 and report the problem to your
            software specialist.

            The user should then be able to log in at the same  terminal.
            If the user cannot, there is a problem with the terminal, the
            terminal line, or the system.  Report the situation  to  your

   7.17  LOGGING OUT A USER WITH LOGOUT   7.17  LOGGING OUT A USER WITH LOGOUT

   To delete unwanted jobs from the system, type the command:

        LOGOUT n

   where n is the number of the job you want to delete.  You  must  first
   enable  your operator privileges.  Also, be absolutely sure that a job
   is unwanted before you log it out.  The types of unwanted jobs  should
   be  listed  for  you by the system manager.  Then you can periodically
   give the SYSTAT command and check the output against the list to  find
   any  unwanted  jobs.   A  possible  list  of unwanted jobs and ways of
   identifying them in the SYSTAT output are:

        1.  Jobs that have not used  any  runtime  over  a  certain  time
            period.   Periodically, use the command SYSTAT TIME or SYSTAT
            n TIME, where n is a job number, to see if the job's  runtime
            has increased.

        2.  All jobs that have been detached longer  than  five  minutes,
            provided  your  system  manager  has decided not to allow any
            detached jobs and has sufficiently warned all users of  this.
            This   means   you  should  log  out  all  users  whose  line
            designation in the output from SYSTAT  is  DET,  which  means
            detached.  However, you are never able to log out SYSJOB.

        3.  A job that a user has requested you  to  log  out  due  to  a
            problem.   Be sure the request is valid.  Then check that the
            job number the user wants you to  log  out  belongs  to  that
            user.   Do this by typing PUSH to OPR and then type SYSTAT n.
            For example:

            where n is the job number, and check that the  user  name  is
            correct.  If the name is correct, you can log out the job.

                            ----- Example -----

   Because there is no message printed on your terminal to indicate  that
   you  have  successfully  logged out another job, you can use SYSTAT to
   verify that the job is gone.  However, keep in mind that by  the  time
   you  give the SYSTAT command a user could already have that job number
   again.

   If you log out a job that was a subjob  of  PTYCON,  PTYCON  prints  a
   message about the subjob being killed.

   7.18  GENERATING ACCOUNTING REPORTS   7.18  GENERATING ACCOUNTING REPORTS

   The USAG20 and USAH20 programs allow you to produce accounting reports
   from  system  accounting  data.   The  CHKPNT  program  enables you to
   include disk usage in these reports  and  makes  the  accounting  data
   available  to  USAG20  and  USAH20.   In  addition, the CHKPNT program
   allows you to change the accounting periods during normal operation.

   These accounting functions are  discussed  briefly  in  the  following
   sub-sections.   You  can  find more information in the TOPS-10/TOPS-20
   USAGE File Specification.

   You must discuss with your system manager the schedule  (if  any)  for
   performing these tasks.

   If you do not want any reports on disk usage, omit Step 4 above.

   The EXPUNGE command to CHKPNT in  Step  6  deletes  and  expunges  all
   system  accounting data files already processed by the COPY command to
   CHKPNT.  If you want to save these files, you should rename them, copy
   them,  or  save them with DUMPER before you expunge them.  The file is
   called SYSTEM-DATA.BIN in BS:<ACCOUNTS>.  If you do not expunge  these
   files, the next COPY command to CHKPNT reprocesses them and makes them
   available to USAG20 or USAH20 again.

   If your system manager wants to change the accounting  period  between
   shifts  to  bill users at a different rate for the next shift, you can
   give the following command to the CHKPNT program:

        ______                       _____        CHANGE (ACCOUNTING SHIFT NOW)<RET>

   This command causes a session end entry followed  by  a  session-start
   entry  for  every  active  job  in  the  system.   There is no visible
   indication to the user that an accounting shift change has occurred.

   steps.  First, be sure that you processed system accounting data  with
   the COPY command to CHKPNT.  You might or might not have included disk
   usage.   Second,  be  sure  you  have  USAG20.CHG  in  your  connected
   directory.   Your  system  manager  should  have created USAG20.CHG by
   using the information in the TOPS-10/TOPS-20 USAGE File Specification.
   Then, type to OPR:

        1.  PUSH

        2.  ENABLE

        3.  USAG20

        4.  input file specification

            This is the file output by the COPY command to CHKPNT in  the
            previous section.  The default is USAGE.OUT in your currently
            connected directory.

        5.  S or D

            S gives a report of system usage, and D  gives  a  report  of
            disk usage.  Press RETURN to get system usage, the default.

        6.  N or A

            N sorts the report by directory name, and A sorts the  report
            by account.  Press RETURN to get name, the default.

        7.  output file specification

            This is the file that contains the report.   The  default  is
            USAGE.RPT in your currently connected directory.

        8.  EXIT

        9.  PRINT output file specification/REPORT:argument

            The argument must correspond to the type of report requested.
            The type of report and arguments are:

                    Report             Argument

            System usage by name       NAME
            System usage by account    ACCOUNT
            Disk usage by name         DNAME
            Disk usage by account      DACCOUNT

       10.  DISABLE

       11.  POP to return to OPR

   If you want to produce different reports, after Step  5,  go  back  to
   Step 2.

   For easy identification you might use  an  output  file  specification
   that indicates the day or week of the report.

   As the operator, there  are  several  software  tasks  involving  both
   system  programs  and commands that you need to perform.  Some of them
   must be done on a daily basis and in a particular order.   Others  can
   be  done  less  frequently or only on request.  Your system manager or
   operations staff should establish a daily schedule,  (perhaps  divided
   into  by operator shifts, and weekly, monthly, or yearly schedules, if
   appropriate).

   The following sections in Chapter 8  discuss  in  chronological  order
   possible  scheduled  software tasks.  These tasks are the tasks you do
   after you ready the system for timesharing.   You  should  follow  the
   schedule  given  to  you by your system manager or operations staff to
   determine when you need to perform a task.

                                    NOTE

           For  you  to  perform  any  scheduled  software   task
           described  in  Chapter  8,  you  must  have  WHEEL  or
           OPERATOR capability.   If  either  capability  is  not
           needed  to  perform  the  task, it is mentioned in the
           description of the task.

|  Note that you can use the /CLUSTER-NODE:   switch  with  the  commands
|  described  in  this  chapter  to  affect  jobs on specified nodes in a
|  CFS-20 cluster.



   8.1  SETTING LOGINS-ALLOWED AND OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE   8.1  SETTING LOGINS-ALLOWED AND OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE

   When the system is started, you must allow LOGINs on  the  appropriate
   terminals  and  indicate  that  you are present.  To do this, take the
   following steps:

        1.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        2.  Type ENABLE.

        3.  Give the INFORMATION (ABOUT) SYSTEM-STATUS command.

        4.  Use ^ESET LOGINS-ALLOWED if you need to  change  the  set  of
            terminals for LOGINs.

        5.  Use ^ESET OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE, if necessary,  to  indicate
            that you are present.

        6.  Type POP to return to OPR.

   You can also use this procedure later to change the set  of  terminals
   from  which  LOGINs  are allowed, or to indicate that there is not any
   operator  present.   (Details  on  ^ESET  LOGINS-ALLOWED   and   ^ESET

   OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE   commands  in  the  file  SYSTEM:n-SYSJOB.RUN.
   Decide with your system manager what ^ESET commands, if any,  need  to
   be  in  the  n-SYSJOB.RUN  file, and when you should manually change a
   ^ESET parameter.  It might be wise to put ^ESET LOGINS-ALLOWED ANY  in
   the  n-SYSJOB.RUN  file, but to make the operator on duty do the ^ESET
   OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE.  Thus, if there is no operator  on  duty,  the
   status   is  NO  OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE.   The  defaults,  before  the
   n-SYSJOB.RUN file  is  read,  are  LOGINS  ALLOWED  from  the  CONSOLE
   TERMINAL and PSEUDO-TERMINALS with NO OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE.



   8.2  CREATING THE MESSAGE OF THE DAY WITH MAIL   8.2  CREATING THE MESSAGE OF THE DAY WITH MAIL

   To send a message to all users of the system, do the following:

        1.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        2.  Enable capabilities.

        3.  Run MAIL.

        4.  After the TO:, type SYSTEM.

        5.  After the CC:, press RETURN.

        8.  End the message with ESCape or CTRL/Z.

        9.  Type POP to return to OPR command level.

   The message is put into the file MAIL.TXT in PS:<SYSTEM>.  Then when a
   user   logs   in  to the system, the user receives on his terminal the
   messages that he has not seen before.  Also, as  soon  as  you  finish
   sending mail to SYSTEM, all on-line terminals receive the message:

   The base account  validation  file  contains  entries  for  each  base
   account  in  the  system.   The  format  of  the entries for each base
   account is:

        ACCOUNT name/SUBACCOUNT:file specification
        USER user name, user name,...
        DIRECTORY structure:<directory>
        GROUP (ON STRUCTURE) structure:/USER:user group number
        GROUP (ON STRUCTURE) structure:/DIRECTORY:directory group number

   Part of the format is optional, and some entries  can  be  given  more
   than once.

   Each entry can also specify an expiration date with:

        /EXPIRES:dd-mm-yy hh:mm

   When you place /EXPIRES:  after an account name, user name, directory,
   or  group number, the expiration date applies to that item only.  When
   you place /EXPIRES:   immediately  after  USER,  the  expiration  date
   applies to all user names.

   The various entries are briefly described below.

   ACCOUNT             Specifies the name of the base account.

   /SUBACCOUNT:        Specifies the file containing additional data  for
                       the  base  account.  The ACCOUNT entry allows only
                       one /SUBACCOUNT:.

   If you need to add a directory or user  name  to  the  system,  or  to
   change  some  directory  parameters,  or  delete  a directory from the
   system, use the ^ECREATE command.



   8.5.1  Adding Directories for Users   8.5.1  Adding Directories for Users

   To give users the ability to log in to the  system,  you  must  create
   directories  for  them  on  PS:,  the  public structure.  Use the name
   approved by your system manager for the directory name for a user.

                                    NOTE

           By default, the public structure is the boot structure
           (BS:),  also  known as the system structure.  However,
           if  your  system  manager  has  enabled   the   "login
           structure"   facility,   PS:    points  to  the  login
           structure.

   If the directory name contains a  ".",  for  example,  <C.SMITH>,  the
   directory   is   actually   a   subdirectory.   Before  you  create  a
   subdirectory, you must first have created its superior  directory,  in

   this  case  <C>.   You  can  determine  the  superior  directory for a
   subdirectory by using the name of the subdirectory and eliminating the
   last  "."  and  the  characters  after  it.  For example, the superior
   directory for <AL.BROWN> is  <AL>,  and  the  superior  directory  for
   <B.BLACK.1> is <B.BLACK>.

           If you are connected to structure PS:   when  you  are
           creating  a  directory  to allow a user to log in, you
           can omit PS:  in the ^ECREATE command.

   8.6  DUMPING DIRECTORY PARAMETERS WITH DLUSER   8.6  DUMPING DIRECTORY PARAMETERS WITH DLUSER

   Once you add, change, or delete a directory, you should run DLUSER  to
   get  a  backup copy of the directory parameters defined with ^ECREATE.
   Also, if your installation allows users to change directory parameters
   with  SET DIRECTORY or to create subdirectories with BUILD, you should
   get this backup copy periodically at a time scheduled by  your  system
   manager.   The backup copy can be used to restore directory parameters
   when you are recovering part of the file system.

   The following three sections explain how to dump directory parameters:

        1.  Dump directory parameters for the system structure, BS:,  and
            create  a  system  backup  tape.   This  tape  is helpful for
            restoring directories.  (See Section 8.6.1)

        2.  Dump directory parameters  for  structures  other  than  BS:.
            Section 8.6.2

        3.  Use DLUSER.  (See Section 8.6.3)



   8.6.1  Dumping Directory Parameters for BS:   8.6.1  Dumping Directory Parameters for BS:

   You should put a backup copy of directory  parameters  for  BS:   onto
   magnetic   tape.    For   ease  in  restoring  the  directories  after
   re-creating the file  system,  you  should  also  have  the  following
   critical system programs on the same tape as the directory parameters.

        1.  BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE

        2.  SYSTEM:EXEC.EXE

        3.  SYS:DLUSER.EXE

        4.  SYS:DUMPER.EXE

        5.  All files from BS:<NEW-SYSTEM> and BS:<SYSTEM>

        6.  All files from BS:<NEW-SUBSYS> and BS:<SUBSYS>

        7.  All files from BS:UETP.LIB

   To dump user directories  from  BS:   with  DLUSER  and  put  them  on
   magnetic  tape  along  with the files listed above, type PUSH to OPR>.
   Then:

        1.  Type SUBMIT SYS:SYSTAP.CTL.

        2.  Wait until SYSTAP.LOG and SYSTAP.LPT are printed on the  line
            printer.

        3.  Look at the two printed files.  If there are errors, try  the
            SUBMIT command again or notify your system manager.

        4.  Once the control file runs without  error,  file  the  backup
            tape along with the two listings.

   8.6.2  Dumping Directory Parameters for Other Structures   8.6.2  Dumping Directory Parameters for Other Structures

   If there are other structures in addition to BS:  on your system,  put
   a backup copy of the directory parameters for each of those structures
   into files SYSTEM:str.TXT, where str: is the relevant structure  name.
   If  it  is not the system structure, you can also use OPR to MOUNT and
   DISMOUNT the structure.

   For each structure, type to OPR>:

   8.6.3  Using DLUSER   8.6.3  Using DLUSER

   The following discussion gives more detail on DLUSER if  you  want  to
   run it from your terminal.

   Once DLUSER is running, it outputs DLUSER> as its prompt.  Then, after
   it  finishes  a  command, it outputs the prompt again.  You can type ?
   after the prompt to get a list of the DLUSER commands.   While  DLUSER
   is  processing a DUMP or LOAD command, you can find out what directory
   it is currently working on by typing CTRL/A.  When you type CTRL/A you
   receive the message:

        WORKING ON DIRECTORY structure:<directory>

   The commands to DLUSER are:

        DUMP filespec      specifies to dump directory parameters into  a
                           file  specification  (filespec).   The default
                           file specification is DSK:USERS.TXT.

        EXIT               specifies to exit from DLUSER  and  return  to
                           the monitor.

        HELP               specifies   to   display   a   help    message
                           summarizing  the  functions  and  commands  of
                           DLUSER.

        LOAD filespec      specifies to load directory parameters from  a
                           file specification (filespec).

        STRUCTURE name     specifies the structure name  (name)  that  is
                           used  for  the  DUMP  or  LOAD  command.   The
                           default is your connected structure.

   sure to run DLUSER (Section 8.6.3) and dump the directories.



   8.7.1  Listing Directory Parameters with ^ECREATE   8.7.1  Listing Directory Parameters with ^ECREATE

   If you expect to change some  directory  parameters,  this  method  is
   useful.

   To list all the parameters of one  directory,  use  the  LIST  VERBOSE
   command  to  ^ECREATE.   To  list only nondefaulted parameters for the
   directory, use the LIST command to ^ECREATE.  Type to OPR>:

        1.  PUSH

        2.  ENABLE

        3.  ^ECREATE structure:<directory>

        4.  LIST VERBOSE or LIST

        5.  DISABLE

        6.  POP

   You can omit the structure name in Step 3 if you are connected to  the
   structure   containing  the  directory.   You  can  also  change  some
                                             _______  __________  _______   parameters after listing them.  (See the  TOPS-20  Operator's  Command
   ________ _________ ______   Language Reference Manual for details on the ^ECREATE command.)

   The LIST VERBOSE subcommand to ^ECREATE outputs the  same  information
   as  ^EPRINT  directory  VERBOSE, and LIST to ^ECREATE is equivalent to
   ^EPRINT directory.  The advantage of  using  the  LIST  subcommand  to
   ^ECREATE, instead of ^EPRINT, is that you can immediately give another
   subcommand to ^ECREATE.

   8.7.3  Listing Directory Parameters with ULIST   8.7.3  Listing Directory Parameters with ULIST

   The ULIST program can give you four types of listings:

        1.  An alphabetic list of all directories on a structure and  all
            the directory parameters

        2.  A numeric list of directories on  a  structure  according  to
            directory numbers and all the directory parameters

        3.  A mini-listing containing only directory numbers and names on
            a structure

        4.  A  directory  group  listing  giving  groups  used,   highest
            directory  in  use,  first free directory, the directories in
            each group, the users having access to each group, the  users
            with   special   capabilities,   and   directories  that  are
            files-only.

   To run ULIST, you must have OPERATOR or WHEEL capability, but  you  do
   not need to type ENABLE.  Type PUSH to OPR> and type:

        1.  ULIST

        2.  ULIST commands, separated by <RET>,  to  select  the  desired
            type and format of listing

        3.  BEGIN to start the listing

        4.  EXIT to return to TOPS-20 command level

   When ULIST is running,  it  prompts  with  ULIST>  for  each  command.
   Follow  each  command  with <RET>.  To see the commands to ULIST, type
   HELP as the command.  For example:

   The  different  types  of  lists  are  obtained  with   the   commands
   ALPHABETIC,  NUMERIC,  MINI, and DIRECTORY.  These commands correspond
   to the explanations at the beginning of this section.  If you  do  not
   specify  the type of list, NUMERIC is assumed.  Each of these commands
   produces a different listing.

   If you want the output on narrow paper (80 columns), give  the  NARROW
   command because WIDE (132 columns) is the default.

   The listing is printed on your terminal, because output  to  TTY:   is
   the  default,  unless you give the OUTPUT or PRINT command.  The PRINT
   command gives you a listing on the line printer.  OUTPUT followed by a
   file  specification puts the listing into the file given.  The default
   file for the OUTPUT command is USERS.TXT.

   While the system is running, you may have to check on  the  status  of
   certain  jobs,  system  statistics,  or  devices.  the following three
   sections discuss various ways of doing these tasks.



   8.8.1  Determining the Status of Jobs with SYSTAT   8.8.1  Determining the Status of Jobs with SYSTAT

   To get a summary of the jobs being used on the system, use the  SYSTAT
   command.   It  tells  you  the  job  number,  the terminal line number
   connected to that job, the program  being  run,  and  the  user.   The
   SYSTAT  command  can  also  be  followed  by an argument to get a more
   detailed summary or a specific part of the summary or  a  summary  for
   another node in a CFS-20 cluster.  For example:

         ______ _        @SYSTAT n

   where n is a job number, prints out information for job n only.

         ______ ____        @SYSTAT user

   where user is a user's name,  prints  out  information  for  the  jobs
   logged in by that user only.

            Statistics  are  gathered  over  every fixed or variable time
            period and then output.

                                    NOTE

                  The length of the time  period  actually
                  used   may   not  be  exactly  what  you
                  specified,  because  the   printing   of
                  information  may delay the next sampling
                  period.  Do not make the time period too
                  small,   because  WATCH  itself  uses  a
                  considerable amount  of  time.   A  time
                  period of two minutes is reasonable.


   To stop WATCH from reporting the statistics,  type  two  CTRL/Cs.   To
   stop the WATCH program and the reporting of statistics, type RESET and
   press the RETURN key.  Then, if your output was to a  disk  file,  you
   can PRINT it on the line printer.

   For additional information on the WATCH program, refer to the  TOPS-20
   WATCH document.

                            ----- Example -----

   This example shows the output for one  time  period  of  two  minutes.
   Note  that  you must type CTRL/C twice to exit from WATCH.  Otherwise,
   for this example, WATCH would print a report every two minutes.

   8.10  REPORTING SYSTEM ERRORS WITH SPEAR   8.10  REPORTING SYSTEM ERRORS WITH SPEAR

   SPEAR is a program that selectively lists and  formats  parts  of  the
   system  error  file  <SYSTEM-ERROR>ERROR.SYS  on the system structure.
   You should run it daily for summary information (see Example 1  below)
   and  file  it  for  later  reference  by  your  DIGITAL  Field Service
   Representative.  Then, whenever  a  piece  of  hardware  seems  to  be
   failing,  run  SPEAR  again  and  request  a  detailed report for that
   device.

   To enter reports on users  and/or  devices  into  ERROR.SYS,  use  the
                                                       _______ __________   REPORT  command at OPR command level.  Refer to the TOPS-20 Operator's
   _______ ________ _________ ______   Command Language Reference Manual for a complete  description  of  the
   OPR REPORT command.

   To run SPEAR, type the following to OPR>.

        4.  EXIT

        5.  POP

   When SPEAR is started, it prompts with the SPEAR prompt.  At that time
   you  can  type  a  command  line  to  SPEAR.   When SPEAR has finished
   processing one command line, it prompts again with the  SPEAR  prompt,
   so  you  can  give  another  command  line.   Type EXIT to leave SPEAR
   command level.

   To see the SPEAR help file on your terminal, type a "?" to  the  SPEAR
   prompt.

   SPEAR can also process commands from a disk file as well as from  your
   terminal.   This disk file, an indirect command file, is useful if you
   have a command line that you often use.  To make an  indirect  command
   file, create a file with the same command line that you would normally
   type to SPEAR from your terminal.  Then type the following to SPEAR:

        @dev:name.typ

   where dev:  is the location of the file (default is DSK:) and name.typ
   is the name of the indirect command file.

   8.11  BACKING UP DISK FILES WITH DUMPER   8.11  BACKING UP DISK FILES WITH DUMPER

   To minimize loss of disk files, you should put backup copies of  files
   on  magnetic  tape with DUMPER.  This should be done on a daily basis.
   You have the option of saving either all disk files or only those that
   have  not  been  saved  before  (called  an  incremental save).  It is
   advisable to save all files once a week and to do an incremental  save
   the  other  days.  An incremental save includes those files which have
   not been saved since the last incremental save or  full  save.   Check
   with  your  system  manager  to  make sure that the correct version of
   DUMPER is used to back up files.

   If your  installation  has  structures  other  than  PS:,  the  public
   structure,  be  sure  to  back  up files on those structures too.  Use
   different magnetic tapes for  different  structures,  and  follow  the
   procedure  for  a  full  save  or incremental save for each structure.
                 _______ ____ _________ _____   (Refer to the TOPS-20 User Utilities Guide for details on  the  DUMPER
   utility  program.)  If  your installation is part of CFS, you must run
   DUMPER on the processor that has a direct connection to  the  required
   tape drive.

                                  WARNING

           When you are backing up the system structure never use
           a  labeled tape.  The reason for this is if the backup
           tape is the only method you have to BOOT  the  system,
           the  software  components  you  need  to read the tape
           label are not running.

   The following steps explain the DUMPER procedure with OPR  and  DUMPER
   commands.

                                    NOTE

           DUMPER does not work on a 7-track magnetic tape  drive
           (TU71).

   To save all disk files of a structure, do the following:

        1.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        2.  Type ENABLE.

        3.  Type MOUNT TAPE setname:  with the /WRITE-ENABLED switch, the
            /LABEL-TYPE:   switch,  and the /VOLIDS:  switch, the /NOWAIT


                                    8-48

            switch, and any additional switches  desired  for  the  MOUNT
            command.  It is important to give as many volids as you think
            you need to backup all the files you want to save.

        4.  Physically mount and ready a tape that has been assigned  for
            DUMPER backups.

        5.  When MOUNTR replies with the Tape Mount Request and with  the
            acknowledgement  of  the  tape being mounted, press <RET> and
            type POP to return to OPR.

        6.  If it is an unlabeled tape, give the IDENTIFY command to  OPR
            to identify the tape drive to the mount request.

        7.  When MOUNTR replies with Tape Drive Given To Request  number,
            type PUSH to OPR.

        8.  If you want to save files from a structure other than PS:  or
            BS:, type MOUNT STRUCTURE str:.

        9.  After the system has displayed the defined tape drive for the
            setname:, type DUMPER.

       10.  Type the following DUMPER commands:

            TAPE MTn:     or     TAPE setname:
            SAVE /FULL-INCREMENTAL str:

            Structure is the name of the structure for which you did  the
            MOUNT  above,  or  it  is  omitted  along  with  the colon to
            indicate your currently connected structure.

            As DUMPER starts to save files  for  each  directory  on  the
            structure, it prints the structure and directory name.

       11.  If you receive the message:

            [Mounting next tape volume]

            mount another tape as specified in the MOUNT TAPE command  on
            MTn  or  any  available tape drive.  Then press CTRL/C twice,
            POP to OPR, and IDENTIFY the tape drive to the mount request.

       12.  When MOUNTR replies  the  acknowledgment  that  the  tape  is
            mounted,  type PUSH to OPR, and type CONTINUE to continue the
            DUMPER backup process.

       13.  After DUMPER has finished the SAVE, DUMPER prints  two  total
            lines, and you are prompted with the DUMPER> prompt.

       14.  Type EXIT to DUMPER.

       15.  Type DISMOUNT TAPE MTn:  to rewind and unload the tape.   You
            can  also  type  DISMOUNT TAPE setname:  to rewind and unload
            the tape.

       16.  If you did a MOUNT STRUCTURE above, type  DISMOUNT  STRUCTURE
            str:.

       17.  Type DISABLE.

       18.  Type POP to return to OPR.

       19.  Physically remove the tape(s) from the drive(s).

       20.  Store the magnetic tapes and DUMPER's output to your terminal
            in the place decided upon by your system manager.

                             ----- Hints -----

   If you do not specify enough volids to backup the  mounted  structure,
   the  system prompts you with the following when DUMPER reaches the end
   of the last reel specified in the MOUNT command:

        hh:mm:ss  <n>     --Key In Next Volume Identifier--
                        Supply next volume-id for tape set setname:

                        Respond with either of:
                          VOLUME volid
                          REFUSE reason

   You must then press <RET>, type POP  to  return  to  OPR,  and  supply
   another  volid  by  giving  the  OPR  command RESPOND nn VOLUME volid.
   Another Tape Mount Request now appears.  You must then mount and ready
   the  tape and IDENTIFY the tape drive to the mount request.  Then PUSH
   and CONTINUE to return to DUMPER and the backup process.

   To save space due to inter-record gaps on the DUMPER  tapes,  you  can
   specify the following DUMPER command before you give the SAVE command:

        SET BLOCKING-FACTOR nn

   This command sets the number of logical records that are blocked  into
   a  single physical record.  The number (nn) must be in a range of 1 to
   15.  The default is 1.  The limits for  the  densities  (BPI)  are  as
   follows:

        1.  Density 200 - 1

        2.  Density 556 - 3

        3.  Density 800 - 4

   If you are saving disk files with DUMPER and the system  crashes,  you
   do  not  have  to start from the beginning after the system is started
   again.  Do the following:

        1.  Leave the tape positioned where it is.

        2.  Type PUSH to OPR>.

        3.  Type ENABLE.

        4.  Type MOUNT TAPE setname:  and specify the same switches  that
            were  specified  for  the tape mount before the system crash,
            but specify new tape volids.

        5.  Type POP to return to OPR and give the  IDENTIFY  command  to
            identify the tape drive to the mount request.  Then type PUSH
            to return to TOPS-20 command level.

        6.  If you are saving files from a structure other than  PS:   or
            BS:, type MOUNT STRUCTURE STR:.

        7.  Type DUMPER.

        8.  Type the following DUMPER commands:

            TAPE MTn:
            INIT <directory>
            SAVE/FULL-INCREMENTAL str: or SAVE /INCREMENTAL:n str:

            where directory is the last directory name output  by  DUMPER
            before  the  system  crashed and structure is the name of the
            structure for which you did the MOUNT above.   You  can  omit
            str:  to indicate your currently connected structure.

        9.  Follow Steps 11 through 20 above.

   If you are restoring files with DUMPER and the system crashes, you can
   use  the same technique stated above.  Simply replace the SAVE command
   and switches with RESTORE and appropriate switches.

   In a CFS-20 cluster, a shutdown on one  system  causes  "system  going
   down"  messages to be transmitted to all systems in the cluster at the
   sixty-minute, five-minute, and one-minute marks.  For example, if SYSA
   is shutting down, the following messages appear clusterwide:

   [System SYSA going down in 60 minutes at 1-Dec-87 16:29:22]

   [System SYSA going down in 5 minutes at 1-Dec-87 16:29:22]

   [System SYSA going down in one minute!!]

   Any time you give a ^ECEASE command while other systems in the cluster
   are  accessing  your  disks by means of the MSCP server, the following


                                    8-55

   message is printed on the CTY, as well as any terminal running the OPR
   program, every time the message "System going down in 'n' minutes" has
   a time of 60 minutes or less.

        Check other cluster systems for structure dismount instructions

   Every time you receive this message, any other system  accessing  your
   disks will receive one of the following two messages.

        NODE-NAME going down at 11-Mar-87 08:34:37.
        Before it is shutdown, this system should dismount
        the following structures

        structure-name  structure-name

   or

        NODE-NAME going down at 11-Mar-87 08:34:37.
        No structure dismounting is needed on this system.

   When the time has expired, the operator on the system  being  shutdown
   will receive the following message.

        [Timesharing is over]

        OPERATOR-WAIT FOR THE MESSAGE 'Shutdown Complete' BEFORE
        ENTERING COMMANDS TO PARSER.

        ALSO, MAKE SURE OTHER SYSTEMS IN THE CLUSTER HAVE
        COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY STRUCTURE DISMOUNTS BEFORE THIS
        SYSTEM IS SHUTDOWN.

   At this time, any other system accessing your disks will  receive  one
   of  the  following  two  messages  on  the CTY as well as any terminal
   running the OPR program.

        NODE-NAME has ceased timesharing
        Before it is shutdown this system should dismount the
        following structures:

        structure-name  structure-name

   or

        NODE-NAME has ceased timesharing
        No structure dismounting is needed on this system.

   If there are users accessing  disk  structures  on  the  system  being
   shutdown,  they  should be notified to dismount those structures using
   the DISMOUNT STRUCTURE command.

   If at any time the operator cancels the shutdown, any  user  accessing
   disks on that system will receive the following message.

        NODE-NAME has canceled its shutdown. It is no longer
        necessary for this system to dismount structures

        structure-name  structure-name

   It should be noted that if no other system is accessing disks  on  the
   system  being  shutdown,  no messages will be printed and the shutdown
   procedures would be the same as a single system shutdown.

   If you also need to power down  the  hardware  after  timesharing  has
   finished, do the following:

        1.  Wait until SHUTDOWN COMPLETE is output on the CTY.

        2.  Type  CTRL/\  (control  backslash)  to  enter   the   console
            processor command language.

        3.  Give  the  SHUTDOWN  command  and  wait  for  the  **HALTED**
            message.

                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES



   While the system is running, unexpected errors may  occur.   Sometimes
   the  system  tries  to  recover,  but other times you may have to take
   corrective action.  This chapter describes some of the errors that you
   may encounter and how to correct them.



   9.1  AUTOMATICALLY RELOADING AND DUMPING THE SYSTEM   9.1  AUTOMATICALLY RELOADING AND DUMPING THE SYSTEM

   Because there is one monitor (TOPS-20)  for  the  main  processor  and
   another  (RSX-20F) for the console front-end processor, it is possible
   for either one to crash (halt or hang) and for either one  to  restart
   the other.

   When TOPS-20 halts because of a BUGHLT (Section 9.4.2), it is  usually
   reloaded  and started by RSX-20F.  During automatic reloading, RSX-20F
   writes  a  KLERR  entry  containing  information  about  the   central
   processor  at  the  time  of the crash.  Once TOPS-20 is running, this
   KLERR entry is appended to the ERROR.SYS  file  (Section  8.10).   The
   automatic   reloading  process  also  dumps  KL  memory  to  the  file
   <SYSTEM>DUMP.EXE on the system structure or on DMP:   if  your  system
   manager has defined this logical name.  Once TOPS-20 is running again,
   that file is automatically copied to DUMP-version-name.CPY, where name
   is the name of the error and version is the edit number of the monitor
   that was running at the time of the crash.  This file is given  a  new
   generation  number  so that successive memory dumps do not destroy any
   previous ones.

   A message similar to the following is sent to the CTY when the copy is
   done:
        Copying system dump
                from:  STR:<SYSTEM>DUMP.EXE.1
                to:    PS60:<DUMPS>DUMP-12345-KPALVH.CPY.1

                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


   When RSX-20F halts, it is usually reloaded by TOPS-20.  However,  some
   output  for  the  CTY  might  not get printed.  This output includes a
   BUGCHK or BUGINF, PTYCON  output,  and  PROBLEM  ON  DEVICE  messages.
   During   a  reload,  the  front-end  memory  is  dumped  to  the  file
   BS:<SYSTEM>0DUMP11.BIN.n, where n is the file generation  number.   On
   successive  dumps, the generation number is increased so that previous
   dumps are not overwritten.  The  filename,  including  the  generation
   number, is placed into ERROR.SYS (Section 8.10).

   For automatic reload of TOPS-20, the front end assumes the  last  used
   bootstrap  device  and  BOOT.EXB  as  the KL bootstrap.  BOOT.EXB then
   reads in the default monitor, BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE.

   When a reload occurs, write as much information as possible about  the
   crash in the installation logbook.  Include the following:

        1.  Date and time of the crash

        2.  TOPS-20 or RSX-20F reload

        3.  Name of the BUGHLT, job number, and user name

        4.  Names of the files containing the TOPS-20 monitor  before  it
            was run and the memory dump

   If your system manager or software specialist decides  to  report  the
   crash to DIGITAL, you must provide:

        1.  The information for the crash from the logbook

        2.  A copy of the memory dump and the TOPS-20 monitor  before  it
            was  run.   Use  DUMPER -- NOT  in  interchange  mode -- on a
            9-track tape at 1600 bits/inch (63 rows/mm)

        3.  The CTY output when the crash occurred

        4.  For TOPS-20 crashes, the output  from  SPEAR  containing  the
            KLERR information

                              ----- Hint -----

   As soon as possible, memory dump files should be put on magnetic  tape
   with DUMPER and deleted from disk to free some space.

   9.1.1  Dumping the System for "Continuable" Errors   9.1.1  Dumping the System for "Continuable" Errors

   In the configuration file, your system manager may have  arranged  for
   BUGINF and BUGCHK errors to generate memory dumps also.  (This feature
   is called "DUMP-ON-BUGCHK.") Dumps for  these  types  of  errors  take
   place  in  a  very  similar  way  as for BUGHLTs:  memory is dumped to
   DUMP.EXE and  then  copied  to  a  .CPY  file.   However,  with  these
   continuable  errors, the DUMP.EXE file is written to one of any number
   of structures you designate as "dumpable," not necessarily the  system
   structure (which is always dumpable).

   To mark a structure as dumpable, give the following command:

       ___ _________ ____  ________   OPR>SET STRUCTURE str:  DUMPABLE

   where:  str is the name of  a  structure  that  is  to  be  considered
   dumpable.

   Later, DUMP.EXE is copied to a .CPY file on DMP:  if that logical name
   is defined or on a different area of the same dumpable structure.



   9.2  MANUALLY RELOADING AND DUMPING THE SYSTEM   9.2  MANUALLY RELOADING AND DUMPING THE SYSTEM

   You must manually reload the system when it is time  for  a  scheduled
   reload  or  when  the  system  is  hung  or  looping, for example, not
   responding to users.



   9.2.1  Scheduled Reloads   9.2.1  Scheduled Reloads

   For scheduled reloads, you can use the  procedure  given  in  Sections
   4.2.1, 4.2.2, or 4.2.3.  However, if the system is running at the time
   you want to reload, you must:

        1.  Give a ^ECEASE command (Section  8.12)  and  wait  until  the
            system  is  down.  At that time, SHUTDOWN COMPLETE is printed
            on the CTY.

        2.  Type  CTRL/\  (control  backslash)  to  enter   the   console
            processor command language.

        3.  Give the SHUTDOWN command.

        4.  After the **HALTED** message, reload the system.

   9.2.2  Reloads and Dumps for a Hung or Looping System   9.2.2  Reloads and Dumps for a Hung or Looping System

   Determining whether it is TOPS-20 or RSX-20F that is hung  or  looping
   might  be  difficult.  If you are able to get to the console processor
   command language by typing CTRL/\, RSX-20F is probably okay.  Assuming
   that TOPS-20 is looping, try the following steps:

        1.  Type CTRL/\ to enter the console processor command  language.
            If you do not get to the PARSER, assume the front end is hung
            and proceed with the steps below for a hung  front  end.   If
            you get the PARSER prompt(PAR>), proceed with Step 2.

        2.  Type REPEAT 5;EXAMINE KL to print the current program counter
            (PC)  and  the  current  state of the priority interrupt (PI)
            system five times.  Save this output.

        3.  Type SHUTDOWN.  If you do not  get  the  message  **HALTED**,
            type CTRL/\ ABORT and press the RETURN key.

        4.  Reload via the switch register (Section 4.2.3) to  enter  the
            dialog, and answer BOOT to the first question.

        5.  When BOOT prompts, type /D<RET> to dump KL memory to the file
            BS:<SYSTEM>DUMP.EXE.   Later the file is automatically copied
            to another name.  When the copy is done,  note  the  filename
            printed on the CTY.

        6.  Press RETURN to load BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE, or type the  name
            of the monitor to be loaded.

        7.  Answer questions in the loading procedure (Section 4.2).

   Assuming the front end is hung, try the following:

        Manually halt the front end by pressing and then raising the HALT
        switch  which is to the right of the switch register.  Wait 10 to
        15 seconds; TOPS-20 may  try  to  reload  the  front  end.   Then
        consider the following three cases.

        1.  If RSX-20F reloaded successfully, and  everything  now  seems
            okay,  report  the  situation  to  your  system  manager  and
            software  specialist.   A  dump  of   front-end   memory   is
            automatically  placed into the file BS:<SYSTEM>0DUMP11.BIN.n,
            where n is the file generation number.  The  filename,  along
            with the generation number, is entered in ERROR.SYS.

        2.  If RSX-20F is reloaded, but the  system  still  seems  to  be
            hung, try the procedure above for TOPS-20 looping.

                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


        3.  If RSX-20F does not reload, for example, you do not  get  the
            following messages:

                 RSX-20F VB16-00 7:40 5-OCT-88

                 [SY0: REDIRECTED TO dev:]
                 [dev: MOUNTED]

            and the console light is on,  TOPS-20  is  probably  looping.
            You  should  then  follow  the  procedure  above  for TOPS-20
            looping.  You could also  wait  about  five  minutes  to  let
            TOPS-20  get  a  BUGHLT,  so that the front end automatically
            reloads  it.   However,  if  RSX-20F  does  not  successfully
            reload, you lose the EXAMINE KL output.  If you let the front
            end reload TOPS-20, once the system is up,  be  sure  to  run
            SPEAR to get KLERR information.

                              ----- Hint -----

   Be sure to log any reloads  in  your  installation's  system  logbook.
   Include the following:

        1.  Any information about the reason for reloading

        2.  When and how the reload was done

        3.  Attachment of EXAMINE KL output, if any

        4.  Whether KL or front-end memory was dumped and to which  files
            they were dumped

   To report the crash to DIGITAL, supply the above information,  a  copy
   of the TOPS-20 monitor before it was run, any memory dumps on magnetic
   tape, and any SPEAR output containing KLERR information.



   9.3  SETTING THE CORRECT DATE AND TIME   9.3  SETTING THE CORRECT DATE AND TIME

   If you notice that  the  date  and  time  printed  by  the  system  is
   incorrect,  immediately  notify  your  system manager.  For accounting
   purposes, he may want you to reload the system.  However, he may  want
   you  to  correct  only the date and time.  You can change the date and
   time with ^ESET DATE-AND-TIME.  If you need to  change  the  date,  be
   sure  you first warn all users via ^ESEND that you are going to change
   the date, because that action may affect their work.

   To correct the date and time, type the following commands:

        1.  PUSH to OPR

   9.4.2  BUGCHKs, BUGINFs, and BUGHLTs   9.4.2  BUGCHKs, BUGINFs, and BUGHLTs

   When TOPS-20 encounters certain questionable situations, it  generates
   a  BUGCHK  or BUGINF.  Then, some informational messages are output on
   the CTY, and TOPS-20 continues.  BUGINFs  are  strictly  informational
   messages.   BUGCHKs indicate a problem.  However, they do not halt the
   system.  When TOPS-20 encounters a situation  from  which  it  is  not
   advisable  to  continue,  it  generates  a  BUGHLT.   TOPS-20  is then
   reloaded and restarted by the front end.

   When a BUGCHK is encountered, the following is output on the CTY:

        ********************
        *BUGCHK "name" AT dd-mmm-yy hh:mm:ss
        *message
        *JOB: n, USER: user-name
        *ADDITIONAL DATA: data, data, data, data
        ********************

   The lines beginning with JOB: or ADDITIONAL DATA: may not appear.  The
   system then continues.

                  After a power-fail restart,  the  system
                  prints   BUGCHK   "PWRRES",  the  system
                  continues,  but  all  jobs   that   were
                  attached to a terminal are detached.  If
                  the detached jobs are  not  attached  to
                  within  five  minutes,  they  are logged
                  out.

   When a BUGHLT occurs, the following is output on the CTY.

   When a crash is reported to DIGITAL, the CTY output similar to that in
   the above example should be saved and sent with the report.

   Whenever the system encounters a BUGCHK beginning with DIR, it  prints
   a  directory  number  after  ADDITIONAL  DATA.  You should then try to
   rebuild that directory's symbol table (Section 9.5.1).  If the rebuild
   fails to correct the problem, proceed with the instructions at the end
   of Section 9.5.1.  It is important to take corrective action  in  this
   case so that files do not get lost.

   9.4.3  HOME Block or BAT Block Inconsistencies   9.4.3  HOME Block or BAT Block Inconsistencies

   When the KL bootstrap is loaded and started,  it  checks  the  primary
   HOME  blocks  on the disk packs for certain information.  It checks if
   the system structure has been mounted  and  if  the  system  structure
   contains all the proper units for the structure.

   If the system structure has not been properly mounted, you may get the
   following error messages from the bootstrap:


   ERROR:      ?DUPL STR UNI

   Reason:     There are two mounted disk packs claiming to have the same
               logical unit number.

   Recovery:   Check to see if you have the proper  disk  packs  mounted.
               If  the  proper disk packs are mounted and the error still
               continues to occur, contact your  software  specialist  or
               DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


   ERROR:      ?HOME BLKS BAD

   Reason:     The logical unit number is out of range.

   Recovery:   Check to see if you have the proper  disk  packs  mounted.
               If  the  proper disk packs are mounted and the error still
               continues to occur, contact your  software  specialist  or
               DIGITAL Field Service Representative.
   ERROR:      ?MISSING UNIT

   Reason:     One or more logical units are missing from the structure.

   Recovery:   Check to see if all the proper disk packs are mounted.  If
               all  the  proper  disk  packs  are  mounted  and the error
               continues to occur, contact your  software  specialist  or
               DIGITAL Field Service Representative.

   After any of the above errors, BOOT prompts again.  To load a  TOPS-20
   monitor, type the monitor filename or press RETURN to get the default.
   If the proper packs are mounted and an  error  still  occurs,  consult
   your software specialist or Field Service Representative.

   what areas of the disk have been  found  to  be  bad.   The  following
   messages may occur.

                        ----- Warning Messages -----

   %BAT BLOCK FULL ON BS UNIT n

        The monitor continues to run with no space in the  BAT  block  to
        mark  bad  areas  of the disk.  Inform your DIGITAL Field Service
        Representative so that he can  correct  the  problem.   You  then
        should reformat the pack and re-create the file system.

   %BAT BLOCKS DO NOT COMPARE ON BS UNIT n

        The BAT blocks on unit n look valid, but they are not  the  same.
        When  BAT  blocks  are  updated,  the  primary one is done first.
        Therefore, if the system crashes  before  the  secondary  one  is
        updated, they are different.  In this case, the primary BAT block
        is copied into the secondary one.

   %COPYING PRIMARY BAT BLOCKS TO SECONDARY ON BS UNIT n

        See explanation above.

   where x is a device or APR, n is the PC value, and y is either MONITOR
   or USER.

   Other applicable information for each message is then printed  on  the

   If any of these parity errors occurs, save the  CTY  output  from  the
   errors and notify your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


                                    NOTE

                  As  memory  parity  errors  occur,   the

   This section describes the recovery procedures for the  various  error
   messages that can appear when you are using tapes.  The following list
   of the error messages, the  reason  for  the  error  message  and  the
   recovery procedure.

                         ----- Error Messages -----

   ERROR:     --TAPE WRITE PROTECT ERROR--
              MTAn:  VOLUME VOLID
              order WRITE RING AND REMOUNT TAPE
                   where "order" is either INSERT or REMOVE

   Reason:    A user requested a  volume  to  be  write-enabled  and  the
              volume was mounted write-protected, or vice versa.

   Recovery:  If the volume should be write-protected, remove  the  write
              ring and physically remount the tape.  If the volume should
              be write-enabled, insert  the  write  ring  and  physically
              remount the tape.
   ERROR:     --NO RING IN SCRATCH TAPE--
              UNLOADING DRIVE MTAn:  VOLUME VOLID
              REMOUNT SCRATCH TAPE WITH WRITE RING

   Reason:    A scratch tape was mounted without a write ring.

   Recovery:  Insert a write ring and physically remount the tape.


   ERROR:     --REMOUNT TAPE VOLUME--
              MTAn:  VOLUME VOLID BEING UNLOADED
              REMOUNT VOLUME volid ON density BPI DRIVE

   Reason:    A user requested an unlabeled  tape  to  be  mounted  at  a
              specific  density, and the drive it was mounted on does not
              support that density.

   Recovery:  Remove the tape from the current drive and mount  it  on  a
              drive that supports the specified density.


   ERROR:     --TAPE DRIVE TIMED OUT--
              MTAn:  OPERATION TIMED OUT

   Reason:    A tape input/output request issued by MOUNTR took too  long

              to  execute.   This  is an informational message that could
              indicate a problem with a tape drive or a problem with  the
              software.

   Recovery:  Retry the operation.  If the  error  still  persists,  call
              your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


   ERROR:     --TAPE POSITIONING ERROR--
              MTAn:  POSITIONING OPERATION FAILED

   Reason:    While trying to position a volume to a specific  file,  the
              monitor  reported  an  error to MOUNTR.  This error message
              could indicate a bad tape or a bad tape drive.

   Recovery:  Retry the operation.  If the  error  still  persists,  call
              your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


   ERROR:     --TAPE ERROR WRITING LABELS--
              ERROR WRITING LABELS ON MTAn:  VOLUME VOLID

   Reason:    The software encountered an error  while  trying  to  write
              volume  header labels on a tape.  A bad tape drive or a bad
              tape could cause this error.

   Recovery:  There are two recovery procedures for this type  of  error.
              (1)  Mount  the  tape  on another drive and try again.  (2)
              Initialize another volume at the same density,  label-type,
              and VOLID; then use this volume instead of the one that had
              the error.
   ERROR:     --MOUNTR SYSTEM TASK ERROR--
              BAD IPCF MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM component
                   (component = ORION or QUASAR)

   Reason:    MOUNTR received an unrecognized  or  incorrectly  formatted
              IPCF message from either ORION or QUASAR.

   Recovery:  Call your software specialist.


   ERROR:     ?MOUNTR CRASHING, PC=n
              SAVING MOUNTR CORE IMAGE ON FILE <SPOOL> MOUNTR-CRASH.EXE.n

   Reason:    MOUNTR detected an internal error that it could not handle.
              A  copy  of the MOUNTR program at the time of the error has
              been saved in the directory BS:<SPOOL> for analysis.

   Recovery:  Call your software specialist.

   This section describes the error recovery procedures for  the  various
   error  messages that can appear when you are trying to boot the system
   from disk or tape.  The following are the error messages,  the  reason
   for  the  error  message,  and  the  recovery  procedure.   All of the
   following error messages are preceded by ?BOOT:.

                         ----- Error Messages -----

   ERROR:     HALT

   Reason:    BOOT or MTBOOT halts only if it is unable to determine  how
              much   physical  KL10  memory  is  present.   This  message
              indicates incorrect memory configuration  or  interleaving,
              or  memory  hardware  problems.   This situation should not
              ordinarily occur.

   Recovery:  Reconfigure memory and check that  memory  interleaving  is
              correct.   If  the  error  recurs,  call your DIGITAL Field
              Service Representative.


   ERROR:     ?NO READY TAPE DRIVE AVAILABLE

   Reason:    MTBOOT was not  able  to  find  any  magnetic  tape  drives
              on-line  and ready.  This commonly occurs when the operator
              forgets to press the on-line  switch  on  the  drive  after
              mounting the tape.

   Recovery:  Check that the magnetic tape  drive  is  on-line.   If  the
              error  recurs  when  the  drive  is on-line, it indicates a
              hardware malfunction.   Call  your  DIGITAL  Field  Service
              Representative if the problem persists.
   ERROR:     ?HARD DISK ERROR

   Reason:    A disk hardware error occurred during a  disk  input/output
              transfer.

   Recovery:  Call your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


   ERROR:     ?HARD TAPE ERROR

   Reason:    A hardware error occurred while MTBOOT tried to  read  from
              magnetic  tape.   MTBOOT  attempts  the  read operation 100
              times before reporting the error.   Any  of  the  following
              three reasons can cause this error:

              1.  A dirty read head on the magnetic tape drive




                                    9-20
                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


              2.  A corrupted or damaged magnetic tape

              3.  Hardware problems,  probably  with  the  magnetic  tape
                  drive

   Recovery:  Read the magnetic  tape  on  another  tape  drive  to  help
              determine if the tape or the tape drive is the problem.  If
              the magnetic tape drive is causing  the  error,  clean  the
              tape  drive  heads.   Refer to the instructions in the tape
              drive operator's guide.  If the tape drive still causes the
              error,  it probably indicates a hardware malfunction.  Call
              your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.

              If the magnetic tape is causing the error, use another copy
              of the monitor tape to reload the system.


   ERROR:     ?BAD HOME BLOCK

   Reason:    The Home block on the  structure  that  BOOT  is  currently
              using  is damaged.  This usually indicates severe structure
              damage.

   Recovery:  Use another copy of the structure,  if  available,  rebuild
              the structure, or reinstall the system.


   ERROR:     ?MORE THAN 1 BOOTABLE STRUCTURE FOUND

   Reason:    BOOT found duplicate bootable structures online.

   Recovery:  Place drives with  duplicate  bootable  structures  offline
              until after system startup.


   ERROR:     ?STRUCTURE NOT FOUND:STR:

   Reason:    BOOT  failed  to  find  a  structure,  on  line,  with  the
              structure   name   you   specified,  or  hardware  problems
              prevented BOOT from finding the structure you specified.

   Recovery:  Make sure the disk drive the structure  is  mounted  on  is
              on-line.  If it is on-line, use another copy of BOOT or the
              monitor.  If the problem still occurs,  call  your  DIGITAL
              Field Service Representative.
   ERROR:     ?COMMAND ERROR

   Reason:    BOOT or MTBOOT was not able to decipher the command.   This
              is generally the result of a typing mistake.

   Recovery:  Retype the command.

   ERROR:     ?FILE NOT FOUND:FILESPEC

   Reason:    BOOT failed to find the file you specified.  The file  name
              was  incorrectly  entered,  the  file  does  not  exist, or
              root-directory or the directory you specified to BOOT  does
              not contain the expected format.

   Recovery:  Retype the file name, if that was  incorrectly  typed.   If
              that  is  not  the problem, check to make sure the file has
              not been deleted, or that the directory the file resides in
              is not damaged.


   ERROR:     ?MEMORY REFERENCE FAILED

   Reason:    BOOT  or  MTBOOT  encountered  an  illegal  address.   This
              usually indicates a hardware problem.

   Recovery:  Run the BOOT program again.  If the problem  still  occurs,
              call your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


   ERROR:     ?FILE NOT IN .EXE FORMAT

   Reason:    BOOT or MTBOOT is currently attempting to load a file  that
              is in an incorrect format.  This message could be caused by
              several reasons.  They are:

               o  the wrong filename was specified

               o  the file could be damaged

               o  the file was generated by CSAVE

               o  the file is not an executable file

   Recovery:  Use another copy of the monitor file.


   ERROR:     ?FILE'S .EXE DIRECTORY IS LONGER THAN 1 PAGE

   Reason:    BOOT found that the .EXE directory was larger than one page
              while dumping.

   Recovery:  Use another copy of the .EXE file.


   ERROR:     IO ERROR - TEXT

   Reason:    A hardware error occurred during an I/O transfer.

   Recovery:  Run the BOOT program again.  If the error still occurs call


                                    9-22

   ERROR:     ?UNKNOWN SWITCH

   Reason:    You specified an invalid switch.

   Recovery:  Retype the command with the correct switch.


   ERROR:     ?INVALID NUMERIC VALUE

   Reason:    You specified a non-numeric argument to a switch  expecting
              a numeric argument.

   Recovery:  Retype the command with the correct numeric argument.


   ERROR:     ?CANNOT FIND BOOTABLE STRUCTURE

   Reason:    There is no valid bootable structure  on-line  or  hardware
              problems  have  prevented  BOOT  from  finding  a  bootable
              structure.

   Recovery:  Make sure the door on the disk drive is closed, and correct
              disk pack is mounted and on-line.  Try running BOOT several
              times.  If problem still occurs, call  your  DIGITAL  Field
              Service Representative.


   ERROR:     ?NO STRUCTURE ID

   Reason:    The structure you specified is  missing  its  structure  ID
              from its HOME blocks.

   Recovery:  Notify your system manager.  If no person at your site  has
              the  expertise  to  correct this problem, call your DIGITAL
              Software Specialist.


   ERROR:     ?DUMP  ERROR - DUMP.EXE  IS  TO  SMALL:   RECONFIGURE  WITH
              MAKDMP

   Reason:    The pre-allocated file DUMP.EXE is not large enough to hold
              all of the memory pages that the BOOT program is attempting
              to dump.   Either  someone  has  recently  run  MAKDMP  and
              specified  a file size that is too small, or new memory has
              recently been added to the system and DUMP.EXE has not been
              configured to accomodate the new memory.

              The dump you receive could be missing pages.

   Recovery:  Run the MAKDMP program to reconfigure DUMP.EXE.

   9.5  RECOVERING THE FILE SYSTEM   9.5  RECOVERING THE FILE SYSTEM

   Problems of different degrees  of  severity  can  occur  in  the  file
   system.  The following sections discuss the simple cases of rebuilding
   a  directory  symbol  table  (Section  9.5.1)  and  reconstructing   a
   directory  (Section  9.5.2),  the more complex cases of reconstructing
   the  ROOT-DIRECTORY  (Section  9.5.3)  and  re-creating  a   structure
   (Section  9.5.4),  and the most complex case of re-creating the entire
   file system (Section 9.5.4).



   9.5.1  Rebuilding a Directory Symbol Table with EXPUNGE   9.5.1  Rebuilding a Directory Symbol Table with EXPUNGE

   When TOPS-20 processes a BUGCHK, BUGINF, or BUGHLT beginning with DIR,
   and  outputs  the  number of the directory and its structure in SIXBIT
   after ADDITIONAL DATA, try to rebuild the directory symbol table.

                                    NOTE

           For rebuilding directory  number  1  (ROOT-DIRECTORY),
           refer to Section 9.5.3.

   To rebuild a directory symbol table, do the following:

        1.  Look at the two  numbers  after  ADDITIONAL  DATA.   Use  the
            second  number  to  determine the structure for the following
            procedure.  If you are at OPR> command level,  type  PUSH  to
            OPR and type the following commands:

                 __________                 RESET<RET>
                 ________                 DDT<RET>
                 DDT
                 ______ ______________        ________                 second number<ESC>6T; PS     <CTRL/C>

            After $6T;, DDT outputs the name of the structure.

        2.  Find  the  directory  name  corresponding  to  the  directory
            number,  that is, the first number after ADDITIONAL DATA.  Do
            this by looking at a numeric ULIST  listing  for  the  proper
            structure.

        3.  Type PUSH to OPR, then type:

                 ___________                 ENABLE<RET>
                 _______ _____________________                 EXPUNGE str:<directory>,<RET>
                 ____________                 REBUILD<RET>
                 _____                 <RET>
                 ________                 POP<RET>

            where structure and directory are names, not numbers.

   Rebuilding the symbol table should eliminate any further BUGs for that
   directory.  If it does not, reconstruct the directory (Section 9.5.2).



   9.5.2  Reconstructing a Directory   9.5.2  Reconstructing a Directory

   If there was a problem with a directory and the procedures in  Section
   9.5.1  did  not  eliminate  the  problem,  you  must  reconstruct  the
   directory by doing the following:

        1.  Try to save the directory's files with DUMPER.

                                    NOTE

           If the directory is a critical one, for which there is
           no  acceptable  backup,  and you cannot save the files
           with DUMPER, notify a DIGITAL software specialist.  He
           might   be   able  to  recover  most  or  all  of  the
           directory's contents.


        2.  Kill the directory with ^ECREATE and the KILL subcommand.  If
            that  fails, see Section 9.5.2.1 to delete the directory with
            the DELETE command.

        3.  Continue with Section 9.5.2.2 to re-create the directory  and
            restore its files.

        4.  DIRECTORY

        5.  <RET>

        6.  POP

   Structure is the name of the structure containing the  bad  directory.
   Determine  the file specification by doing the following on a piece of
   paper.

        1.  Write the name of the bad directory.  Some examples might be:

                 <MUMBLE.FOO>
                 <COT>
                 <A.YOW.1>

        2.  If the name of the bad directory does not contain a ".",  use
            "ROOT-DIRECTORY." as a prefix for the name.  For example:

                 <COT> becomes <ROOT-DIRECTORY.COT>

        3.  The name now contains a "." either because it did  originally
            or  because of Step 2.  Scan the name until you find the last
            ".".  Replace the "." with ">".  For example:

                 <MUMBLE.FOO> becomes <MUMBLE>FOO>
                 <ROOT-DIRECTORY.COT> becomes <ROOT-DIRECTORY>COT>
                 <A.YOW.1> becomes <A.YOW>1>

        4.  Replace the final ">" with ".DIRECTORY".  For example:

                 <MUMBLE>FOO> becomes <MUMBLE>FOO.DIRECTORY
                 <ROOT-DIRECTORY>COT> becomes <ROOT-DIRECTORY>COT.DIRECTORY
                 <A.YOW>1> becomes <A.YOW>1.DIRECTORY

   Then type the file specification you obtained at the end of Step 4  in
   the procedure for deleting a directory.

   If you typed the DELETE command and got the message:

        name.DIRECTORY FILE CANNOT BE EXPUNGED BECAUSE IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN

   plan to stop timesharing by doing a ^ECEASE.  After the  downtime  you

   have  killed  or deleted a directory that needs reconstruction, do the
   following:

        1.  To re-create the directory, run DLUSER  to  load  the  latest
            file you dumped with DLUSER for the structure involved.

        2.  To restore the files of the directory you killed or  deleted,
            use the DUMPER save you just did in Section 9.5.2, Step 1, or
            the most recent DUMPER magnetic tape containing  those  files
            and run DUMPER to restore them.

        3.  If you deleted the  directory,  run  CHECKD  with  the  CHECK
            BITTABLE command and then with the RELEASE command to release
            lost pages.

                                    NOTE

                  Never  run  CHECKD  with   the   RELEASE
                  command    if    a    directory    needs
                  reconstruction.  First, reconstruct  the
                  directory.

   directory  number  1,  or  when  you  get  the BUGHLTS BADROT, BADXT1,
   FILIRD, or FILMAP, try reconstructing <ROOT-DIRECTORY>.   Notify  your
   system manager and software specialist of this before you do anything.

   To determine the structure involved, see step 1 of Section 9.5.1.   If
   the   structure   is   not   BS:,  run  CHECKD  with  the  RECONSTRUCT
   ROOT-DIRECTORY command (Section 9.7) and specify the proper structure.
   If  the  structure  is BS:, you must tell the system to use the backup
   <ROOT-DIRECTORY> and rebuild <ROOT-DIRECTORY> by doing the following:

        1.  Type CTRL/\ to enter the PARSER.

        2.  Type SHUTDOWN to the PARSER.  (If SHUTDOWN does not  succeed,
            type ABORT.)

        3.  Mount system floppy A in drive 0.

        4.  Mount system floppy B in drive 1.

        5.  Mount your most recent system backup tape on MTA0.  If you do
            not  have  a  system  backup  tape, use your TOPS-20 Software
            Installation Tape.

        6.  Be sure the front-end HALT switch is in the ENABLE position.

        7.  Set switches 0, 1, and 2 in the switch register.

        8.  Press the switches SW REG and ENABLE simultaneously.

        9.  Type YES to ENTER DIALOG.

       10.  Type YES to RELOAD MICROCODE.

       11.  If your system has cache, you  will  see  RECONFIGURE  CACHE;
            type ALL.

       12.  Type ALL to CONFIGURE KL MEMORY.

       13.  Type MTBOOT to LOAD KL BOOTSTRAP.

       14.  Type NO to WRITE CONFIGURATION FILE.

       15.  Type /L after MTBOOT>.

       16.  Type /G143 after MTBOOT>.

   9.5.4  Re-Creating the File System or a Structure   9.5.4  Re-Creating the File System or a Structure

   You should re-create the file system or a structure only when:

        1.  You have tried reconstructing  BS:<ROOT-DIRECTORY>,  but  the
            file  system or structure is still in such bad shape that the
            system or structure cannot be used, and

        2.  Your system manager has agreed that you should re-create  the
            file system or structure.

   If reconstructing BS:<ROOT-DIRECTORY> did not solve the  problem,  you
   must re-create the file system, that is, both the system structure and
   front-end file system.  (Refer to Section 9.5.4.1.) If  reconstruction
   of  a ROOT-DIRECTORY on any other structure did not succeed in solving
   the  problem,  just  re-create  that  structure.   (Refer  to  Section
   9.5.4.2.)

   9.5.4.1  Re-Creating the System Structure and Front-End File  System   9.5.4.1  Re-Creating the System Structure and Front-End File  System -
   You  should  re-create the file system on the system structure only at
   your system manager's request or approval.  This request usually comes
   if the file system is in such bad shape that the system cannot be used
   and reconstruction of  the  <ROOT-DIRECTORY>  failed  to  correct  the
   problem.

   To re-create the file system on the system structure, you need:

        1.  The disk packs your system manager chooses for the  new  file
            system

        2.  The latest system backup tape

   9.7  CORRECTING DISK SPACE WITH CHECKD   9.7  CORRECTING DISK SPACE WITH CHECKD

   CHECKD is run automatically at system load time when certain  problems
   are found on the system structure.  CHECKD is also run when you answer
   YES to the RUN CHECKD question at system STARTUP time.

   Type the following commands to run the CHECKD program  during  regular
   timesharing.

        1.  PUSH to OPR

        2.  ENABLE your capabilities

        3.  CHECKD

        4.  Commands to CHECKD terminated by a <RET>

        5.  EXIT command to CHECKD

        6.  POP

                                  CAUTION

           Before you run CHECKD on BS:, be sure  that  you  have
           only  one  structure  named  BS:   on the disk drives.
           Otherwise, there can be confusion over which structure
           is used.

           If your system has two structures named  BS:  on-line,
           where  one  is  just spinning and the other is already
           recognized by the system,  (that  is  mounted  as  the
           system  structure)  and you want to run CHECKD on BS:,
           CHECKD chooses the structure that  is  just  spinning.
           If  CHECKD does not find a BS:  that is just spinning,
           it uses the already recognized system structure.

   Some CHECKD commands should not be used if there are other users using
   the structure.  These commands are:

        1.  CHECK BITTABLE

        2.  REBUILD

        3.  RECONSTRUCT INDEX-TABLE



                                    9-38
                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


        4.  RECONSTRUCT ROOT-DIRECTORY

        5.  SCAN

   If there are other users on the structure and the structure is BS:, do
   a  ^ECEASE  and  wait for the message SHUTDOWN COMPLETE before running
   CHECKD.  If the structure is other than BS:, turn  to  Section  7.11.3
   before running CHECKD.

   If you do not specify a structure in a  CHECKD  command,  CHECKD  uses
   your  connected  structure.   Note  that  at  any time while CHECKD is
   processing directories, you can type CTRL/A to find out  the  name  of
   the directory currently being checked.

   The following commands can be given to CHECKD.


   CHECK BITTABLE (CONSISTENCY OF) str:

                                    NOTE

           Perform CHECK BITTABLE on BS:  at system startup  time
           by  answering  YES  to  CHECKD.  Never issue the CHECK
           BITTABLE command during regular timesharing.

        This command causes the structure's bit  table,  which  indicates
        what  disk  space  is  used, to be checked against the disk space
        that each file  on  the  structure  claims  to  have  used.   Any
        discrepancies  are  listed on your terminal, and the addresses of
        lost pages are written into the file str:<dir>str-LOST-PAGES.BIN,
        where  str  and  dir  are your connected structure and directory.
        This command also executes the CHECK DIRECTORY command to CHECKD.
        (See Section 9.7.1 for more detail on CHECK BITTABLE.)
                                    NOTE

             If you see in the error report any  messages  with
             MULTIPLY   ASSIGNED   DISK  ADDRESS  (meaning  the
             address is used  by  more  than  one  file),  take
             immediate  action.   Refer  to the SCAN command in
             CHECKD (later in this section),  and  perform  the
             steps discussed there.


   CHECK DIRECTORY (CONSISTENCY OF) str:

        This command checks the validity of certain information  in  each
        directory  on  the  structure.   If  an error occurs, the monitor
        rebuilds  the  symbol  table  on  the  specified  structure   and
        recomputes  the amount of disk space used for directories needing
        such action.  If a symbol table is being rebuilt, CHECKD outputs:

             % REBUILDING SYMBOL TABLE FOR structure:<directory>

                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


        If the rebuild is successful, CHECKD then outputs [OK] at the end
        of the message.  Otherwise, it outputs [FAILED].


   CREATE (NEW FILE SYSTEM FOR) str:

        This command creates the file structure according  to  parameters
        that you specify to the questions asked by CHECKD.


   DISABLE
   ENABLE Enables or disables one of the following features.

        AUTOMATIC STARTUP
             Marks the structure  as  the  primary  public  structure  at
             system startup time.  The serial number of the CPU for which
             this is the primary public structure is requested.

        BAT-BLOCK-DELETE
             Allows a verification pass of the  disk  to  delete  entries
             from  the  BAT BLOCKs.  If this feature is disabled, entries
             will only be added.

        ECC-ERROR-MAPPING
             Controls whether ECC errors will be added to the BAT  blocks
             during a verification pass on the disk.  This includes pages
             for which the first attempt to  read  the  page  with  error
             correction  enabled  failed,  but  one  of  the  following 7
             retries was successful.  It is strongly suggested that  this
             switch be ENABLED.

        LARGE DIRECTORIES
             Controls whether directories may  contain  huge  amounts  of
             files  or  not.   Use DISABLE to guarantee that a particular
             structure can be used  on  small  and  large  systems.   Use
             ENABLE  to  allow  directories to grow large on a structure.
             Note that if a directory grows large, the structure will  no
             longer be usable on a small system.

        SOFT-ERROR-MAPPING
             Controls whether soft errors will be added to the BAT blocks
             during  a  verification  pass  on the disk.  Soft errors are
             defined as failure to read the disk without  ECC  correction
             or system error recovery (reading with offset).
        WRITE-VERIFICATION (OF) DATA
             Controls read after write verification of pages  written  to
             the  data space on a disk.  Note that using this feature may
             cause serious performance problems.

        WRITE-VERIFICATION (OF) SWAPPING
             Controls read after write verification of pages  written  to
             the  swapping space on a disk.  Note that using this feature

             may cause serious performance problems.

        PASSWORD-ENCRYPTION
             Controls whether passwords are encrypted or not.


   EXIT (TO MONITOR)

        This command returns you to system command level.


   HELP

        This command prints out a help text.


   LIMIT (NUMBER OF FILES PER DIRECTORY ON) str:

        This command limits the number of  directories  and  files  on  a
        structure.  It also guarantees that if the structure is used on a
        2040S or 2060, it can later be used on a 2040 or 2050.   However,
        the  command  disallows  the 2040S or 2060 feature of adding more
        directories and files than a 2040 or 2050 can support.


   REBUILD (BIT TABLE OF) str:

        This command is for use by your software specialist.  It  is  not
        recommended  for  operator  use.   It causes the bit table on the
        specified structure to be completely rebuilt.

                                    NOTE

                  No one should  be  using  the  structure
                  when   REBUILD  is  used.   Also,  if  a
                  directory   needs   reconstruction,   it
                  should  be  reconstructed before REBUILD
                  is used.


   RECONSTRUCT INDEX-TABLE (OF) str:

        This command is for use by your software specialist.  It  is  not
        recommended  for  operator  use.   This command repairs a damaged
        index  table  file  (str:<ROOT-DIRECTORY>INDEX-TABLE.BIN).   This
        command  cannot  be  used  during timesharing and should never be
        used on your system structure.


   RECONSTRUCT ROOT-DIRECTORY (OF) str:

        This  command  reconstructs  <ROOT-DIRECTORY>  on  the  specified


                                    9-41
                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


        structure.

                                      NOTE

                Do  not   use   this   command   to   reconstruct
                <ROOT-DIRECTORY>  on  the system structure.  (See
                Section 9.5.3.)


   RELEASE (LOST PAGES FROM) file specification (FOR) str:

        This command allows you to free lost pages while other users  are
        on  the system.  When CHECKD reports lost pages, you should first
        resolve any errors indicated by CHECKD (Section  9.7.1)  and  run
        CHECKD  again  with  CHECK  BITTABLE  to  see if errors are gone.
        Then, run CHECKD under <OPERATOR> and use  this  command.   Press
        RETURN   for   the   file  specification  to  indicate  the  file
        str:<dir>str-LOST-PAGES.BIN.n,  where  str  and  dir   are   your
        connected structure and directory, and n is the latest generation
        of the file.  You may also type the name of the file.

        Then, after you EXIT from CHECKD, type:

   EXPUNGE

        to expunge all generations of the file.

                                    NOTE

                  If  a  directory  needs  reconstruction,
                  reconstruct   it  and  issue  the  CHECK
                  BITTABLE command  before  you  ever  use
                  RELEASE.

                  Use the RELEASE command  with  only  the
                  most  current  generation  of  the  lost
                  pages file.


   SCAN (FOR DISK ADDRESSES IN) file specification (FOR) str:

        This command scans the structure  for  addresses  listed  in  the
        specified  file.   Instead  of  specifying  a file containing the
        addresses, you can type TTY:<RET>, type  addresses  separated  by
        <RET>,  and  end  with  CTRL/Z.   The  output  from  the  command
        indicates which files contain the disk addresses specified.  This
        command  is  especially  important  if the CHECK BITTABLE command
        outputs  a  message  indicating  that  an  address  is   multiply
        assigned.

        Use the SCAN command  when  there  are  no  other  users  on  the
        structure  involved.  Therefore, whenever CHECKD finds a multiply

        assigned address on BS:, you should do the following as  soon  as
        possible.  (If the structure is not BS:, remove the structure and
        then follow Steps 4 through 6 below.)

        1.  Type PUSH to OPR.

        2.  ENABLE your capabilities.

        3.  Give the ^ECEASE command  to  stop  timesharing  as  soon  as
            possible.

        4.  Run CHECKD.

        5.  Give the SCAN command to  CHECKD  and  specify  the  multiply
            assigned  address/addresses  as indicated above.  When CHECKD
            finds an address for which it  is  searching,  it  outputs  a
            message  like  the  error  report at the beginning of Section
            9.7.1.  The error field contains  FOUND  DISK  ADDRESS.   For
            each  file  in  which  CHECKD  found an address, it outputs a
            summary line of the form:

                 n SEARCH ADDRESSES FOUND.

        6.  After CHECKD outputs the names of the  files  containing  the
            multiply  assigned address/addresses, try to copy each of the
            files involved to another directory (perhaps  PS:<OPERATOR>).
            (Do  not use RENAME on the original files.)  Then, delete the
            original files, using the FORGET subcommand to  DELETE.   For
            example:

                 $DELETE filespec1,filespec2,<RET>
                 $$FORGET<RET>
                 $$<RET>
                 $

        7.  Type ^ESET LOGINS ANY.

        8.  Run PTYCON.

        9.  Type GET SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO.

       10.  Using MAIL or SEND, notify the owners of  the  deleted  files
            and discuss salvaging their files either from the copy, if it
            was successful, or from a DUMPER tape.

   UNLIMIT (NUMBER OF FILES PER DIRECTORY ON) str:

        This command allows a 2040S or 2060 to create on a structure more
        directories  and  files than a non-2060 can support.  The command
        is used to allow this feature on a structure that was  previously
        limited (the LIMIT command was given for the structure).

                             ----- Hints -----

   When CHECKD is run automatically at system load time because  of  disk
   problems  or  when  you  answer YES to the RUN CHECKD question, CHECKD
   performs the CHECK BITTABLE and CHECK DIRECTORY functions.  You should
   answer  YES  to  the  RUN CHECKD question periodically, perhaps once a
   day, and  always  after  a  disastrous  hardware  failure.   When  the
   standard  PTYCON.ATO  file  is used, one of the operator jobs runs the
   CHECK DIRECTORY function of CHECKD immediately  after  the  system  is
   reloaded.

   9.7.1  Reports from CHECK BITTABLE   9.7.1  Reports from CHECK BITTABLE

   When CHECKD finds  errors  during  the  CHECK  BITTABLE  function,  it
   outputs error reports in the format:



        error(including address n): page type
        SUMMARY FOR FILE file
        m    error type
        - - - - - - -

   Pay close attention to the error portion of the report, and  take  any
   action indicated in the explanation for that error.  The page-type and
   error-type  information  is  for  your  software  specialist,   system
   manager, or owner of the file.

   CHECKD first checks special system blocks, then  swapping  space,  and
   finally  file  pages.   If  an  error occurs in checking the first two
   types of disk usage, the error report includes for each  disk  address
   in error only the first line of the error report format.

   The possible errors output in  a  report  are  discussed  first.   The
   following  conventions  are used in the list of those errors and their
   explanations below:

           n = the number of a sector; the sector is a location on a disk
               pack  relative  to  the beginning of a structure (also the
               number to use in the SCAN command to CHECKD)

        page = four consecutive sectors or the  minimum  allocation  unit
               for disk space

                               ----- Error Messages -----

   ERROR:     DISK ADDRESS n MARKED IN BAT BLOCKS

   Reason:    A page used by the TOPS-20 file system is marked in the BAT
              (bad  allocation  table)  blocks.   This means a hard error
              occurred on this page.

   Recovery:  Try to copy the file.   Then  delete  the  file  using  the

              DELETE  command  with  the  FORGET subcommand.  Notify your
              system manager or the owner of the file that the data in  a
              page  may  have been in error.  If the copy was successful,
              try recovering the file.  Otherwise, recover the file  from
              the most recent backup tape.


   ERROR:     DISK ADDRESS n NOT IN BIT TABLE

   Reason:    A page used by the file system was not assigned in the  bit
              table.

   Recovery:  CHECKD corrects this error automatically.


   ERROR:     ILLEGAL DISK ADDRESS n

   Reason:    CHECKD found a disk address too large for the size  of  the
              structure.

   Recovery:  Try to copy the file.   Then  type  ENABLE  and  press  the
              RETURN  key.  Delete the file using the DELETE command with
              the FORGET subcommand.  Notify your system manager  or  the
              owner  of the file that data in the file may have contained
              errors.  If the copy was  successful,  try  recovering  the
              file.   Otherwise,  recover  the  file from the most recent
              backup tape.


   ERROR:     MULTIPLY ASSIGNED DISK ADDRESS n

   Reason:    CHECKD found a page that was already assigned.  This  means
              two or more files are using the same disk address or a file
              is uing a disk address previously  assigned  to  a  special
              file system block or to the swapping space.

   Recovery:  Use the CHECKD command SCAN to indicate which files contain
              the  disk  address  specified.   (Refer to the SCAN command
              Section 9.7 to resolve this problem.)

   If any of the preceding errors occur, CHECKD also outputs a page type.
   This  indicates  the  usage of the page containing the disk address in
   error.  The page types are:

        FILE PAGE n
        LONG FILE PAGE TABLE
        PAGE TABLE
        SPECIAL SYSTEM BLOCKS
        SWAPPING SPACE

   If CHECKD has reported errors for a file, it then outputs:



                                    9-46
                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


        SUMMARY FOR FILE file

   where file is a complete file specification.  CHECKD follows this with
   summary  lines containing each type of error that has occurred for the
   file, and how many times the error occurred.  Note that one error  can
   sometimes  cause  two  summary  lines.  The error types in the summary
   are:

        ASSIGNED PAGES MARKED IN BAT BLOCKS
        DISK READ ERRORS
        FAULTY ADDRESSES IN LONG FILE PAGE TABLE
        FAULTY ADDRESSES IN PAGE TABLE
        FAULTY LONG FILE PAGE TABLE ADDRESSES IN FDB
        FAULTY PAGE TABLE ADDRESSES IN FDB
        FILE ADDRESSES NOT IN BIT TABLE
        ILLEGAL ADDRESSES
        LONG FILE PAGE TABLES UNREADABLE
        MULTIPLY ASSIGNED ADDRESSES
        PAGE TABLES UNREADABLE

   The last summary line for a file is followed by line of dashes.   Then
   other error reports may follow.

   Once CHECKD has finished checking all the files, it  outputs  a  final
   summary of page counts as follows:

        LOCAL COUNT OF FILE PAGES: i
        LOCAL COUNT OF OVERHEAD PAGES: j
        LOCAL COUNT OF USED PAGES: k

        SYSTEM COUNT BEFORE CHECKD: l
        SYSTEM COUNT AFTER CHECKD: m

   In the above final summary:

        i = number of pages used for data
        j = number of pages used for overhead for the structure; includes
            special system blocks, swapping pages, and overhead pages for
            files
        k = number of pages that CHECKD found to be used
        l = number of pages that the  system  indicated  as  used  before
            CHECKD was run
        m = number of pages that  the  system  indicated  as  used  after
            CHECKD was run

   If there are no errors, i plus j should equal k, and m minus k  should
   equal  lost  pages (discussed later in this section).  If m is greater
   than l, CHECKD found one or more pages that were used but not assigned
   in  the  system  bit  table.   CHECKD assigns them, and m reflects the
   count.  During the last part of the CHECK  BITTABLE  function,  CHECKD
   compares  a  bit  table  it  created with the system bit table for the
   appropriate structure.  CHECKD then compares information  in  the  two


                                    9-47
                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


   tables.   If  page  counts disagree, or if the system bit table says a
   page is not used but CHECKD says it is used, CHECKD outputs:

        ?BIT TABLES INCONSISTENT AT CYLINDER n

   Cylinder n is an area on a disk pack.  This message  indicates  either
   an  error  in  CHECKD  or  the monitor or that someone else is running
   CHECKD which they should not be.

   If the system bit table says that a page is used but CHECKD says it is
   not used, CHECKD counts the page as a lost page.  It then outputs:

        THERE ARE n LOST PAGES
        ADDRESSES ARE IN FILE file

   where n is the number of lost pages found and file is the name of  the
   file containing the addresses of those pages.  The file name is of the
   form  str:<dir>str-LOST-PAGES.BIN.n,  where  str  and  dir  are   your
   currently  connected  structure and directory.  If the file is written
   at system load time, it is BS:<OPERATOR>BS-LOST-PAGES.BIN.n.

   If CHECKD reported an illegal disk address or a multiply assigned disk
   address,  it  does  not  write  the lost page addresses in a file.  It
   outputs:

        %SUPPRESSED WRITING OF LOST PAGES FILE , TOO MANY ERRORS

   If you get this message, correct the errors and run  CHECKD  with  the
   CHECK  BITTABLE function again to get a lost-pages file.  It should be
   noted that the structure remains mounted with the alias name of CHECKD
   even  though  the  SHOW  STATUS  DISK-DRIVES  command  will  show  the
   structure mounted with its actual name and no indication  that  it  is
   still mounted as CHECKD.

   To regain disk space counted as lost pages, see the RELEASE command to
   CHECKD (Section 9.7).

   If there are no lost pages, CHECKD outputs:

        THERE ARE NO LOST PAGES

   If CHECKD finds certain directory inconsistencies which  cause  it  to
   try rebuilding a directory symbol table, it outputs:

        % REBUILDING SYMBOL TABLE FOR str:<directory>

   If the rebuild is successful,  CHECKD  outputs  [OK].   Otherwise,  it
   outputs [FAILED].  It is normal for CHECKD to occasionally rebuild the
   symbol table for <ROOT-DIRECTORY> to account for the space used when a
   directory expands by a page.

   If the rebuild fails, you should try to save,  with  DUMPER,  all  the

   files  in  the  directory  involved.   Then  follow  the procedures in
   Sections 9.5.2.1 and 9.5.2.2.  After that, discuss salvaging the files
   with their owners.

   If you get any of the following messages from CHECKD, perform the same
   procedure  as when a rebuild fails.  In the messages, str:<dir> is the
   structure and directory name of the inconsistent directory.

   When you receive a fatal error message  on  the  CTY  from  a  program
   running under SYSJOB, you must restart it by giving commands to SYSJOB
   via the ^ESPEAK command.  The format of the message follows:

              n = number of the process
        process = name of the process, e.g., INFO
          state = CRASHED or HALTED
              m = PC value
           abcd = content of accumulators 1 to 4

   Also, if you type the SYSJOB  STATUS  command  via  ^ESPEAK  (see  the
   _______  __________ _______ ________ _________ ______   TOPS-20  Operator's Command Language Reference Manual) and there is no
   entry for a program normally run under SYSJOB, you must  restart  that
   program.

   The following programs run as processes under SYSJOB:

        1.  INFO

        2.  ORION

        3.  QUASAR

        4.  MOUNTR

        7.  LPTSPL

        8.  CDRIVE

        9.  SPRINT

   To restart a program under SYSJOB, type the following commands:

        1.  PUSH to OPR

        2.  ENABLE your capabilities

        3.  ^ESPEAK

        4.  RUN SYS:program

        5.  CTRL/Z

        6.  POP

                                    NOTE

           Programs running under SYSJOB must be restarted in the
           same order as they are in the SYSJOB.RUN file.

   example,  MOUNTR,  CDRIVE,  LPTSPL,  BATCON,  and SPRINT (if they were
   previously running).  To restart ORION, you must restart all OPRs.  To
   do this simply run OPR and type any OPR command.



   9.8.1  GALAXY Crash Recovery Procedures   9.8.1  GALAXY Crash Recovery Procedures

   GALAXY programs may stop performing useful work for one of the reasons
   listed  below.   When  a  program  stops  processing, this stoppage is
   referred to as a "crash".  This section describes how you can  recover
   from a GALAXY program crash.

   Reasons for program crashes are:

        1.  A monitor call (JSYS) that should not fail  takes  the  error
            return and an error occurs.

        2.  An error is  detected  by  the  built-in  consistency  checks
            within the various components of GALAXY and an error occurs.

        3.  An undetected  error  eventually  causes  an  illegal  memory
            reference and an error occurs.

   You should take one of the following steps should a  GALAXY  component
   (program)  crash.   It  is  assumed that GALAXY is running as multiple
   forks under SYSJOB.  When a GALAXY components crashes, the core  image
   of  the  component  is  written  in the SPOOL:  area.  The filename is
   XXXXXX-YYY-CRASH.EXE where:

        XXXXXX - is the name of  the  component  that  crashed,  such  as
                 BATCON or ORION.

        YYY - the 3-character error name.

     LPTSPL            If LPTSPL crashes, it will  automatically  restart
                       the jobs which were being processed at the time of
                       the crash from the page  number  recorded  in  the
                       last  checkpoint.  At the CTY, issue the following
                       commands:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       STATUS
                       ^Z

                       Now, using the process number specified for LPTSPL
                       in  the  STATUS  display,  kill off all the LPTSPL
                       processes using the SYSJOB PURGE  command.   There
                       is  one  PURGE  command  required  for each LPTSPL
                       process running under SYSJOB.

                       ^ESPEAK
                       PURGE <fork number>
                       PURGE <fork number>
                       ^Z

                       Now, restart all  the  LPTSPL  jobs  under  SYSJOB
                       using  the  SYSJOB  RUN command.  There is one RUN
                       command required for each line printer you want to
                       start.

                       ^ESPEAK
                       RUN SYS:LPTSPL
                       RUN SYS:LPTSPL
                       ^Z

                       The  line  printer  spooler(s)  is  now  ready  to
                       process   user   requests   again.   If  required,
                       re-issue the OPR START commands to restart the LPT
                       processing.


     CDRIVE            If CDRIVE crashes, all jobs currently  being  read
                       from the card reader will be lost and will have to
                       be  restarted.   To  restart  CDRIVE,  issue   the
                       following commands:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       KILL CDRIVE

                       The card reader spooler is now ready to read cards
                       again.    If  required,  re-issue  the  OPR  START
                       commands to restart the CDR processing.

     SPRINT            If SPRINT crashes, it can be  restarted  without
                       loss  of  data.   To  restart  SPRINT, issue the
                       following commands:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       KILL SPRINT
                       RUN SYS:SPRINT
                       ^Z

                       The card reader  interpreter  is  now  ready  to
                       start  processing  spooled card decks again.  No
                       OPR commands are necessary  (or  available)  for
                       controlling SPRINT.


     SPROUT            If SPROUT  crashes,  all  jobs  currently  being
                       processed  are  restarted  from the beginning of
                       the current file.  To restart SPROUT, issue  the
                       following commands:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       KILL SPROUT
                       RUN SYS:SPROUT
                       ^Z

                       The card punch/plot  spooler  is  now  ready  to
                       start   processing   user  requests  again.   If
                       required, re-issue the  OPR  START  commands  to
                       restart the CDP/PLT processing.


     ORION             If ORION crashes, the  only  indication  of  the
                       crash will be the dump which gets printed on the
                       CTY.  After ORION is restarted, all OPR programs
                       running  at  that  time will automatically reset
                       the OPR/ORION link with the first command  typed
                       to   the   OPRs.    The   first   command   that
                       re-establishes the OPR/ORION link will be lost.

                       Any DN60 termination remote stations  should  be
                       shut  down  and  restarted.   To  restart ORION,
                       issue the following commands:

                       ^ESPEAK

                       The operator controller program is now ready  to
                       process  OPR  commands and route messages to the
                       appropriate processors.


     OPR               If OPR crashes, just restart it ($R OPR).

     BATCON            If  BATCON  crashes,  first  display  the  batch
                       stream  status  from  OPR.  For all active batch
                       streams, issue a LOGOUT  command  for  each  job
                       running  under batch.  Logging the jobs off will
                       not delete the queue entry.  The batch job  will
                       be restarted when BATCON is restarted.  When all
                       active batch jobs have been  logged  out,  issue
                       the following commands to restart it:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       KILL BATCON
                       RUN SYS:BATCON

                       The batch controller is  now  ready  to  process
                       user  requests again.  If required, re-issue the
                       OPR  START  commands  to   restart   the   batch
                       processing.


     QUASAR            If  QUASAR  crashes,  user  requests  for  queue
                       services  will  not be lost.  QUASAR maintains a
                       queue on BS:<SPOOL> which contains copies of all
                       outstanding user requests.  Restarting QUASAR is
                       a problem, however.   QUASAR  also  maintains  a
                       list  of  all  running  GALAXY  processors.   If
                       QUASAR is restarted, it no  longer  knows  about
                       the  rest  of  the  GALAXY spoolers.  To restart
                       QUASAR, first determine  what  batch  jobs  were
                       running  at  the  time of the crash and log them
                       out.  Next,  issue  the  following  commands  to
                       restart QUASAR:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       KILL QUASAR

                       The request controller is now ready  to  process
                       user requests again.  However, since QUASAR does
                       not know about any  running  spoolers,  ALL  the
                       spoolers  must  also be restarted.  In addition,
                       you must restart MOUNTR,  the  mountable  device

                       restarting  the  following  spoolers:    LPTSPL,
                       BATCON, CDRIVE, SPRINT, SPROUT.

                       Assuming  that  MOUNTR  is  also  running  under
                       SYSJOB,  issue the following commands to restart
                       it:

                       ^ESPEAK
                       KILL MOUNTR
                       RUN SYS:MOUNTR
                       ^Z

                       After the spoolers and MOUNTR are restarted, you
                       must run OPR and give the TAKE command using the
                       SYSTEM.CMD file and any other command files used
                       for  system  startup.   This will restart normal
                       GALAXY processing.


     NEBULA            If NEBULA  crashes,  cluster  GALAXY  activities

                       disallowed.  Issue  the  following  commands  to
                       restart NEBULA:

                       ^ESPEAK

                       RUN SYS:NEBULA ^Z


     LISSPL            If LISSPL crashes, remote cluster printing  will
                       be  disallowed.  Issue the following commands to
                       restart LISSPL:

                       ^ESPEAK

   9.11  TOPS-20 MONITOR NOT FOUND   9.11  TOPS-20 MONITOR NOT FOUND

   If you are loading the  system  using  the  KL  bootstrap  that  reads
   TOPS-20  from  disk and, after the message KLI -- BOOTSTRAP LOADED AND
   STARTED, you get:

        ?FIL NOT FND

   the bootstrap was not able to find on disk the  TOPS-20  monitor  that
   you  specified.  Unless you specified a name after a BOOT> prompt, the
   file not found was BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE.

   Consider the following:

        1.  If you specified a nondefault monitor name, be sure you typed
            the correct directory name and filename.

        2.  Be sure you have loaded a bootstrap that loads a monitor from
            disk.

        3.  Be sure the appropriate disk packs are mounted and  that  the
            drives are on-line.

        4.  If you wanted the default monitor, you must try  to  load  it
            from  magnetic  tape  (Section  4.3.2) using your most recent
            system  backup  tape  (Section  4.1.6.1).   Either  the  file
            BS:<SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE  has been destroyed on the disk or some
            other problem possibly a hardware  error,  has  affected  the
            file system.

        5.  If the system comes up for timesharing  after  you  load  the
            monitor from magnetic tape, chances are that only the monitor
            file on disk was bad.  You should restore a good copy of  the
            monitor from a DUMPER tape to BS:<SYSTEM>.

        6.  If the system does not come up for timesharing, it is  likely
            that  there are problems with the file system.  First consult
            your software specialist.  He may  want  to  investigate  the
            situation     before    recommending    reconstructing    the
            ROOT-DIRECTORY or the lengthy procedure  of  re-creating  the
            file system.

   During a system reload, if you see the message:

        PS NOT FOUND. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE SYSTEM STRUCTURE?

   the system was not able to find a structure named PS:.  You must  then
   type  the  name  of  the  structure  that  is  going  to be the system
   structure.  As long as the TOPS-20  monitor  continues  to  run,  that
   structure  will  be  known  as  PS:.  It will not be recognized by its
   original name that you typed in answer to the question.  Note that the
   system  structure  must  have swapping space, usually a front-end file
   system,  an  appropriately  installed  <SYSTEM>  and   <SUBSYS>,   and
   directories to allow users to log in.

   If the bootstrap failed to load during a  system  reload,  you  should
   zero memory and then try to reload again.  This is sometimes necessary
   after a power failure but should occur infrequently.  If  the  problem
   continues, call your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.

   To zero or clear memory, type the following at the CTY.

   9.14  MANUALLY RELOADING THE DX20   9.14  MANUALLY RELOADING THE DX20

   The DX20 is usually started when you load the system.   At  that  time
   the BOOT or MTBOOT program loads and starts the microcode in the DX20.
   However, in  the  following  situations,  you  must  reload  the  DX20
   manually:

        1.  If the DX20 has been taken off-line for maintenance  and  you
            do not want to reload the entire system to reload the DX20

        2.  If you are told to load a specific DX20 microcode  file  that
            is different from the one BOOT or MTBOOT would load

        3.  If you have users complaining that none of  the  TU70  series
            magnetic  tape  drives  or  RP20  disk  drives  on a DX20 are
            working

        4.  If the DX20 loses power

   To manually reload the DX20, type the following commands:




                                    9-59

        1.  PUSH to OPR

        2.  ENABLE your capabilities

        3.  DX20LD

        4.  SYS:DXMCA (for tape) or SYS:DXMCE (for RP20 disks)

        5.  /E

        6.  POP

   The above steps reset the DX20, load the microcode file  SYS:DXMCA.ADX
   or  SYS:DXMCE.ADX,  verify  the  microcode,  start  it,  and exit from
   DX20LD.

        OPR>

   The preceding steps and example show the most common  use  of  DX20LD.
   However,  there  are switches in DX20LD for specific functions.  After
   FILE:, the DX20LD prompt, you can type a command line in the form of a
   file specification followed by switches and <RET>.

   The file specification for the DX20 microcode is  SYS:DXMCA.ADX.   The
   default  directory  is  your  connected  directory.  Note that neither
   recognition nor the help facility (typing ?) is available in DX20LD.

   After a command line is processed or an error occurs,  DX20LD  prompts
   again for another command line.

   The DX20LD switches and their functions are:

        /C        If you specify a DX20 microcode  file  before  /C,  the
                  DX20  memory  is  cleared  and the microcode is loaded,
                  verified, and started.  If you do not specify  a  file,
                  only DX20 memory is cleared.

        /D:CD     The functions specified are done on RH20 controller  c,


                                    9-60
                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES                         ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURES


                  DX20  d,  where c and d are octal numbers.  If you omit
                  /D, DX20LD looks for a DX20.  If only one is found,  it
                  is  used.   However,  if more than one is found, DX20LD
                  outputs an error message which says to use /D.

        /E        DX20LD exits to TOPS-20 command level.

        /L        The file specified is loaded into the DX20.

        /R        Specifies DX20 for RP20 disk drives.

        /S:N      The DX20 is started at location  n  in  the  microcode,
                  where  n  is  an  octal  number.   The default starting
                  address is 1.

        /T        Specifies DX20 for TU70 tape drives.

        /V        The DX20 memory is verified against the file specified.
                  Do  this  verification  only  after  loading and before
                  starting the DX20.

   You can use the switches in combination.  However, if you  use  /L  or
   /V,  the  functions  of only the specified switches are performed.  If
   you specify a file and /C or /S without /L or /V, the file  is  loaded
   into  the  DX20  and  verified,  and  the  functions  of the specified
   switches are performed.  If you do not use any switches, the  DX20  is
   reset and the file you specified is loaded, verified, and started.

   ERROR:     ?1ST CHARACTER IN DATALINE WRONG

   Reason:    The first character in the line of data DX20LD  reads  from
              SYS:DXMCA.ADX  must  be  a  semicolon,  a  W,  or a C.  You
              probably entered the wrong filename.  If the  filename  was
              entered correctly, the file is probably corrupted.

   Recovery:  Retype the filename correctly.  If the  error  recurs,  use
              another copy of SYS:DXMCA.ADX.


   ERROR:     ?2ND CHARACTER IN DATALINE WRONG

   Reason:    The character which follows a C or W in the first  position
              in the line of data DX20LD reads from SYS:DXMCS.ADX must be
              a space.  If the file name was entered correctly, the  file
              is probably corrupted.

              copy of SYS:DXMCA.ADX.


   ERROR:     ?CHECKSUM ERROR IN DATALINE

   Reason:    The checksum  DX20LD  computed  on  the  line  of  data  in
              SYS:DXMCA.ADX  does not match the checksum in SYS:DXMCA.ADX
              for  that  line  of  data.   The  .ADX  file  is   probably
              corrupted.

   Recovery:  Use another copy of SYS:DXMCA.ADX.


   ERROR:     ?COLON ILLEGAL FOR SWITCH

   Reason:    The switch you specified does not accept a colon.

   Recovery:  Retype the command or file name and switches correctly.


   ERROR:     ?COMMAND STRING TOO LONG

   Reason:    The command line you typed is too long.  It  must  be  less
              than 100 characters.

   Recovery:  Type a command line that is less than 100 characters long.


   ERROR:     ?CRAM PARITY ERROR DURING VERIFICATION

   Reason:    You specified the switch /V and a parity error occurred  in
              the DX-20 during the verification procedure.

   Recovery:  Call your DIGITAL Field Service Representative.


   ERROR:     ?CRAM VERIFICATION - NO MATCH

   Reason:    You  specified  the  /V  switch,  and  the  disk  file  you
              specified  did  not match the file in the DX20 CRAM memory.
              The filename specified was wrong, or the data in  the  DX20
              is incorrect.

   Recovery:  Retype the correct filename and  switches.   If  the  error
              recurs, use another copy of SYS:DXMCA.ADX.

   Reason:    The data words in the file you specified are  delimited  by
              carriage returns; they should be delimited by commas.

   Recovery:  Retype the file name.  If the  error  recurs,  use  another
              copy of SYS:DXMCA.ADX.


   ERROR:     ?ILLEGAL SWITCH

   Reason:    The switch you specified is not a valid switch for DX20LD.

   Recovery:  Retype the file name and correct switch.


   ERROR:     ?INVALID SWITCH (2ND CHARACTER MUST BE A SPACE OR A COLON)

   Reason:    You must type a space or a colon  after  typing  the  first
              letter  of  the switch.  For example, you cannot use /VE to
              verify; you must use /V.

   Recovery:  Retype the file name and the correct switch.


   ERROR:     ?  JSYS ERROR:  FILE DOES NOT EXIST

   Reason:    The file you specified does not exist.  Perhaps  you  typed
              the  wrong  file  name.  The standard file specification to
              use is SYS:DXMCA.ADX.  If you do not specify a  file  type,
