VERIFY.DOC -- Changes from V4(2) to V5(2)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

VERIFY is a file/program checksum and version number  comparator.   It
allows  a  user  to  provide a list of files to be verified.  The file
contains the file checksum and (if an .EXE)  a  version  number.   The
verification  that  all  compared software is the intended (or proper)
software is the sole purpose of this program.

VERIFY version 5(2) runs on all releases of TOPS-20.

VERIFY can depend on other software during its execution.

VERIFY will, if requested, connect to the UETP (User  Enviroment  Test
Package) and notify it whenever mismatches occur.

VERIFY is not documented.
