UUOSYM.DOC -- Changes from V16(773) to V17(1061)
January 1986






1.0  SUMMARY

This release  of  UUOSYM  conforms  to  the  7.03  and  later  monitor
releases.

This version is upwards compatible from previous  versions  of  UUOSYM
and fully supersedes all previous versions.

The contents of UUOSYM.MAC are documented thoughout the Monitor  Calls
Manual of the software notebooks.

Note that UUOSYM.MAC is used to compile many program  on  the  release
tape.   None of these changes affect the resulting .REL or save files,
but other software distributed this month and in future months depends
upon  this version to assemble.  This version was assembled with field
image MACRO version 53B.



1.1  Purpose Of UUOSYM.MAC

UUOSYM.MAC is designed to form a consistent definition of monitor  UUO
symbols which occur frequently in the development of user-mode support
programs.  A table  of  contents  gives  the  general  layout  of  the
information.   The definition of a particular symbol can best be found
from the CREF listing of UUOSYM.  All symbols are ASUPPRESSED so  that
unreferenced definitions are deleted.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

See the edit history in UUOSYM.MAC.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile using MACRO version 53B  or  later.   There  are  no  assembly
options or parameters.  The command to compile UUOSYM is:

          .COMPILE UUOSYM/CREF

The output is a UNIVERSAL file, UUOSYM.UNV, and  a  relocatable  file,
UUOSYM.REL.   UUOSYM.UNV  should  be  placed on UNV:.  The REL file is
used to build other programs such as DDT.

To create a file identical in specification  and  effect  to  the  old
C.MAC  concatenate  CHEAD.MAC  (found on the Customer Supported Tape),
MACTEN.MAC, and UUOSYM.MAC into one file (C.MAC):

          .R PIP
          *C.MAC/A=CHEAD.MAC,MACTEN.MAC,UUOSYM.MAC

and use this file as a replacement for C.  This will be the last  time
C  is  documented.  Therefore, it highly recommended that any programs
searching C be converted to SEARCH UUOSYM, MACTEN.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
