October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

PA1050 version 5(350) is the TOPS-10 UUO simulator produced  from  the
file  PAT.MAC.   It  gets mapped into the address space of any program
that executes a TOPS-10 UUO.  Its function is to intercept all TOPS-10
UUO's and simulate them with the appropriate TOPS-20 JSYS's.

PA1050 version 5(350) runs under the TOPS-20 Release 5 monitor.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Magtape OPEN byte size  adjusted  to  correspond  to  OPEN  conditions
(Labeled/Unlabeled,Format,Hardware data mode).  See code for details.

FILOPS implemented (0 -> 15).



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

PA1050 is intended to be used to support  only  the  standard  TOPS-20
software  (FORTRAN,  COBOL,  etc.).   PA1050  reflects TOPS-10 version
5.06.
