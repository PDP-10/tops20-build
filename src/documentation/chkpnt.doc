CHKPNT.DOC -- Changes from V4(113) to V5(116)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

CHKPNT has three major functions:

     1.  Compile account statistics on disk space utilization.

     2.  Set the monitor checkpoint interval.

     3.  Copy system-generated accounting data to the accounting file.

CHKPNT version 5(116) runs only on Release 5 of TOPS-20.

CHKPNT is documented in the TOPS-20 Operator's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

It is possible for CHKPNT to suffer column overflow while doing a NOUT
for  certain  records.   This error is not fatal, and CHKPNT continues
processing records;  only the data in the overflowing  field  will  be
suspect.   However,  an  annoying  repetition  of  the message "Column
overflow ..." results.  The error reporting mechanism has been changed
such  that the column overflow message is typed only once, followed by
the number of occurrences detected.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs or deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES
