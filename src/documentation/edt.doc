1.0  INTRODUCTION

This document describes  how  to  install  version  1.0  of  the EDT-20
editor on the DECSYSTEM-20.

This manual  is  intended  for  the  system  manager  responsible  for
installing and maintaining the EDT.

You can find additional information in the EDT User Reference Manual
and EDT Primer.



2.0  SUMMARY

     EDT is an interactive text editor currently available on  several
DIGITAL operating  systems including:  VAX/VMS, RSTS/E,  RSX-11M,  and
RSX-11M-PLUS.  EDT-20  Version 1.0  adds  TOPS-20 to  that list  as  a
member of the EDT  product family.  EDT-20  is compatible with  VAX/11
EDT Version 3.0, and is a bundled product.

	EDT Version 1.0 will  run under TOPS-20  version 5.1 or  later
monitors and under TOPS-20 version 4.1 or later monitors for KL  model
A and 2020 processors.  It requires Microcode 326 or later.

Refer to the beware file, EDT.BWR, for hints and potential problems.



3.0  PRODUCT SOURCES

The EDT V1.0 kit contains product sources in  machine  readable  form.
These  sources  are included only as a reference and are not warranted
or supported by Digital Equipment Corporation.

The sources are also included to build MAKHLP.EXE and WAIT.EXE.  These
are included for use  only as a  reference with their  use in the  EDT
build  procedure.   MAKHLP.EXE  and  WAIT.EXE  are  not  warranted  or
supported by Digital Equipment Corporation.

4.0  COMPATIBILITY WITH VAX/11 EDT 

EDT-20 is compatible with VAX/11 EDT V3.0.

5.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs or deficiencies as of January, 1985.


6.0  DECSYSTEM-20 Installation

The first step in installation should be to restore the files from the
documentation  save-set  to  disk,  and  read  EDT.DOC (this file) and
EDT.BWR.

Next, EDT.EXE,  EDTHELP.HLB,  and  EDTCAL.REL should  be  restored  to
PS:<SUBSYS>.

If EDT is to be built from sources, the source save-set should be restored
to a directory pointed to by the logical name EDTSRC:.  The build save-set,
which contains the control files needed to build EDT, should be restored
to EDTBLD:.

7.0  BUILDING EDT ON TOPS-20


                                 NOTE

               Before  you  attempt  to  build  EDT  on
               TOPS-20,  make  sure  you have Autopatch
               Tape 8,  or  later,  installed  on  your
               system.



To build EDT  on TOPS-20,  first modify  EDT.CMD so  that the  logical
names point  to  the  appropriate directories  on  your  system.   The
following files are required to build EDT:

	SYS:	BLISS	.EXE	; VERSION 4(216)
	SYS:	LINK	.EXE	; VERSION 5.1(2066)
	SYS:	MACRO	.EXE	; VERSION 53.1(1152)
	SYS:	PA1050	.EXE	; VERSION 5.1(635)
	SYS:	GLOB	.EXE
	SYS:	MONSYM.UNV 	
	SYS:	MACSYM.UNV 
	SYS:	JSYS.REQ
	SYS:	MONSYM.L36

Then submit the control file  in  the following manner:

   o  SUBMIT EDT.CTL/TIME:02:00:00/UNIQUE:YES/RESTARTABLE:YES

After the  batch job  finishes  processing, check  the log  files  for
errors.
