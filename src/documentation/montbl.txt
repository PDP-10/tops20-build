     Descriptions manual.  This manual provides detailed text
     descriptions of internal monitor tables.  Each table is displayed
     showing its storage locations.  Table and section lengths are
     defined.  All symbols, pointers, and displacements are defined to
     indicate their table word offset and values.
 
     Where applicable, field symbols and their bit values or contents
     are defined with their on/off status.  Appendix A provides an
     alphabetical list of monitor tables within their defined modules.
 
     The TOPS-20 Monitor Table Descriptions manual can be printed out
     on any available line printer.  The file does contain wide
     examples, so plan to print on a printer that will accomodate
     the wide examples.
