SYSJOB.DOC -- Changes from V4(10) to V5(10)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

SYSJOB is a program for controlling system background programs.  It is
normally  started  only  by job 0, and it creates additional processes
and jobs as necessary.  An operator or other privileged job  may  pass
commands  to  SYSJOB  via an EXEC command (Ctrl-E) SPEAK to affect the
status of the background programs.

SYSJOB Version 5(10) runs on TOPS20 Release 5.

SYSJOB  does  not  require  any  other  software  modules  for  normal
execution.

SYSJOB is  documented  in  the  TOPS-20  Operator's  Guide  under  the
(Ctrl-E)SPEAK command.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

A new command, "DUMP" has been added to dump a fork's contents.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Mount the tape labeled  Installation  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     SKIP MTA0:5 FILES
     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     RESTORE <*>SYSJOB.EXE TO: <SYSTEM>*.*.-1
     REWIND

4.1  Files Needed to Run SYSJOB

The monitor expects to find SYSJOB.EXE in SYSTEM:  at startup.  SYSJOB
in  turn  expects  to  find the file SYSJOB.RUN in SYSTEM:.  This file
contains the initial set of commands to  start  the  usual  background
programs  and  the  operator  job.  If the monitor is started in debug
mode, (DBUGSW=2), SYSJOB  will  look  for  the  file  SYSJOB.DEBUG  in
SYSTEM:   instead  of  SYSJOB.RUN.   This allows a different (possibly
null) set of background programs to be started when debugging.   While
SYSJOB  is running it periodically looks for a file in SYSTEM:  called
SYSJOB.COMMANDS.  If such a file exists, SYSJOB executes the  commands
in the file and deletes the file.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing SYSJOB

SYSJOB.EXE and SYSJOB.RUN are loaded into  SYSTEM:   as  part  of  the
normal  installation  and disk refresh procedure.  New versions may be
installed by copying the .EXE file to SYSTEM:.  The new  version  will
be  used  the  next  time  the monitor is started, or a command may be
given to SYSJOB to cause an immediate reload.


4.3  Files Needed to Build SYSJOB

SYSJOB is built from the following file:

     SYSJOB.MAC

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building SYSJOB

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND
     ^C
     SUBMIT SYSJOB.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST

4.5  Special Considerations

SYSJOB must be available in SYSTEM:.  Copies in other directories  are
not required.  SYSJOB should not be started manually if the job 0 copy
is running normally, since this would  automatically  start  redundant
copies  of  the  background  programs  and conflicts would occur.  For
debugging purposes, an internal flag may be set which causes SYSJOB to
use  an  initial command file other than SYSJOB.RUN.  Consult a source
listing for details.

Commands may be given to SYSJOB during normal system operation by  use
of the (Ctrl-E)SPEAK command.  See the Operator's Guide for details.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to SYSJOB.TCO for detailed information about changes.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
