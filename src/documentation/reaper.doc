1.0  SUMMARY

REAPER is a program that is run by the operator or a  privileged  user
to  mark  files  for  migration  to  tape.  This migration can be done
either on the basis of the age of the file, or  if  the  directory  is
over quota.

REAPER version 6(301) runs on TOPS-20 Release 6.

REAPER does not require any other software modules  during  execution.
However,  following  a  REAPER run, DUMPER must be run to copy to tape
any files that REAPER marked for migration.

REAPER is documented in the TOPS-20 Operator's Guide



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The TAKE command can have a SKIP command that references non-existant
directories;  the non-existant directories generate a warning message
and are otherwise ignored.

A new command, POLICY, exists.  It is equivalent to TAKE SYSTEM:REAPER.CMD.
It takes no arguments.

TAKE<CR> is now used to end a TAKE file silently.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run REAPER

be processed by giving the TAKE command to REAPER.

REAPER is loaded in SYS: as part of the installation  procedure.   New
versions may be put into use by copying the REAPER.EXE file onto SYS:.
