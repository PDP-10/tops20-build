Proces:

; This is the  code that  will check  to see  if the  process that  is
; running the DIX sample application server is an enabled wheel. It is
; used to determine the number of passive links that should be opened.
; The DIX sample application server will open four passive links for a
; non-enabled wheel process and will open six links passive links  for
; an enabled wheel.
