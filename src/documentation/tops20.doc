PRODUCT SUMMARY                                              21 Jun 88


     1.0  PRODUCT SUMMARY

          TOPS-20 version 7 includes all the  facilities  of  previous
     versions  of  TOPS-20 and enhancements through autopatch tape 18.
     It includes the new software capabilities and  components  listed
     in this document.

          TOPS-20 version 7 is  a  product  only  on  the  KL10  based
     2060/2065 systems.  A new update to the TOPS-20 documentation set
     is included with this release.



     1.1  TOPS-20 Version 7 System Facilities Specifications

          The  following   list   outlines   the   major   points   of
     configuration and hardware support introduced since version 6.1.

     1.  A TOPS-20 version 7 cluster may consist of up to 16 nodes.  A
         maximum  of  four  (4)  of  these  nodes  may be KL10 Model B
         processors running TOPS-20 version 7.  The remainder  of  the
         nodes may consist of HSC50 disk subsystems.

     2.  TOPS-20 version 7 is not supported on Model A processors.

     3.  TOPS-20 version 7 supports the use of HSC50 based  disks  for
         use  as  PS:   consistent with the restrictions listed in the
         description of the Login Structure feature.

     4.  Changes in GALAXY version 6 support the use of LAT  printers,
         TTY devices as printers, DQS client mode printing and routing
         in a CFS cluster for physical printing.

     5.  TOPS-20 version 7 supports the use of TU79 tape drives.

     6.  TOPS-20 version 7 supports a maximum of  64  disk  structures
         consistent  with  the restrictions placed on creation of disk
         structures within TOPS-20.

     7.  TOPS-20 version 7 requires  that  version  442  of  the  KL10
         microcode   be   installed  and  running  in  order  to  boot
         successfully.

SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES                                        21 Jun 88


     2.0  SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES

          This  section  contains  a  brief  description  of  the  new
     features of TOPS-20 which have been introduced since version 6.1.



     2.1  Monitor Features

          The following is a list of the changes made to  the  monitor
     during release 7 development.



     2.1.1  Cluster-wide ENQ% And DEQ%

     A new function of the ENQ% JSYS allows programs to  specify  that
     all ENQ%, DEQ%, and ENQC% activity performed by the process is to
     be coordinated by the monitor on a cluster-wide basis.



     2.1.2  Separate Login Structure

     Changes to the monitor and the CHECKD utility  allow  the  system
     manager  to specify any structure available to the system as PS:.
     This structure will be used by the monitor  to  obtain  usernames
     and  login  directories.  Old restrictions for the PS:  structure
     now apply only to the structure from which  BOOT  will  load  the
     monitor and to which the system will perform swapping activities.
     Logical name BS:  is defined by the monitor at system startup  to
     point to this structure.



     2.1.3  Dump On BUGCHK

     An unsupported tool, DOBOPR, which makes use  of  a  new  TOPS-20
     JSYS,  DOB%,  allows  an  operator  or  system manager to specify
     certain BUGCHKs or BUGINFs upon which  the  system  will  take  a
     continuable  dump  of memory.  These dumps are of the format that
     in the past was available only when a BUGHLT  occurred.   Certain
     restrictions pertaining to the type of BUGINF or BUGCHK exist and
     are documented.



     2.1.4  INFO% JSYS

     This  JSYS  allows  a  user  to  perform  certain  functions   of
     informational  JSYSes  on a remote node running TOPS-20 version 7
     in a CFS cluster.  This JSYS also includes  some  functions  that
     are not directly related to JSYS functions but return information
     convenient to system programmers.

SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES                                        21 Jun 88


     2.1.5  Offline Structures

     When a  disk  unit  goes  offline,  the  monitor  will  mark  the
     structure  to which it belongs as offline after a system settable
     timeout interval has passed.  When a structure is marked offline,
     new  access  to  the  structure will be prevented by returning an
     error to user programs when certain  JSYSes  are  executed  which
     specify the offline structure as an argument.



     2.1.6  Recognition To The Point Of Ambiguity

     This feature involves a change to the manner in which recognition
     is  performed on file specifications and COMND% JSYS switches and
     keywords.  Specifically, given multiple  filespecs,  switches  or
     keywords  which  contain  the same characters at the beginning of
     their strings, the monitor will recognize the string to the point
     where  they  diverge  when  the  escape (<ESC>) or control-F (^F)
     characters are typed.



     2.1.7  Host-Initiated LAT Connections

     This feature, also known as reverse LAT, is specified by  version
     5.1 of the LAT protocol.  Additional functions of the LATOP% JSYS
     allow a user program to initiate  and  terminate  connections  to
     ports  or  services  offered  by  a  LAT  server  running the 5.1
     protocol and to perform I/O to these TTY-style devices using  the
     standard TOPS-20 I/O JSYSes.



     2.1.8  Cluster Dumping

     Using one of three different methods, an operator  can  crash  an
     entire TOPS-20 version 7 CFS cluster simultaneously, provided the
     cluster is in a reasonable state of stability.  This  feature  is
     for  use  primarily  as  a  debugging tool in the case of serious
     cluster problems and is not supported for general use.



     2.1.9  Increased Structure Limits

     A TOPS-20 version 7 monitor can support up to 64  structures,  up
     from 32 in a 6.1 monitor.

SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES                                        21 Jun 88


     2.1.10  Four Node CFS Support

     A TOPS-20 cluster may contain  up  to  four  KL10  nodes  running
     TOPS-20  version  7  or  TOPS-20 version 6.1 at autopatch tape 12
     level or above.



     2.1.11  CFS Joining Messages

     If a TOPS-20 version 7  CFS  node  cannot  join  the  cluster  at
     startup  time,  it  will  display  diagnostic messages on the CTY
     detailing the cause of the problem.  This behavior was absent  in
     TOPS-20  version 6.1 and resulted in what appeared to an operator
     as a hung system  since  startup  will  not  continue  until  CFS
     joining is completed.



     2.1.12  Startup Question Timeout

     If either or both of the two startup questions "Why  Reload?"  or
     "Run  CHECKD?"  is  not answered within 1 minute of being issued,
     default answers will be displayed and startup will continue.  The
     default answers are "OTHER - Question Timeout" and "NO - Question
     Timeout" respectively.



     2.1.13  PMOVE And PMOVEM Instructions

     These two new instructions were added to the KL10 microcode as of
     version 442 to perform the MOVE and MOVEM functions to a physical
     memory location.  They were  added  to  the  monitor  to  replace
     software  routines  which  emulated this functionality.  This was
     done for  performance  reasons.   Note  that  TOPS-20  version  7
     requires  this  version  of the microcode or higher to run.  This
     version of the microcode was shipped on a 6.1 update tape.



     2.1.14  New GETAB% Words

     Two new words are added to the GETAB% Tables.  The first  is  the
     ACTJOB  word which contains the lowest job number logged into the
     system (excluding job 0) in the right half and  the  highest  job
     number  in  use  in the left half.  The second is the WHOJOB word
     which contains the  number  of  jobs  logged  into  the  OPERATOR
     account  (excluding  job  0)  in the right half and the number of
     user jobs logged in in the left  half.   This  function  is  used
     primarily  for  performance  enhancements  to  the  EXEC's SYSTAT
     command.

SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES                                        21 Jun 88


     2.1.15  Minimum Password Length

          A minimum of 1 to 39 characters can now be enforced  on  the
     length of each user's unencrypted password string.



     2.2  Utility Changes

          The following is a list of all utilities and tools that have
     been upgraded for TOPS-20 version 7.



     2.2.1  SETSPD

     The SETSPD for version 7 contains the following changes:

      o  Dump on BUGCHK - Add a new entry point for use by  DOB  which
         copies  dumps  to  the  next  available  dumpable  structure.
         Change  the  naming  scheme  for   copied   dump   files   to
         "DUMP-nnn-bugnam.CPY";  where "nnn" is the monitor edit level
         and "bugnam" is the name of the BUGHLT.   Add  ENABLE/DISABLE
         DUMP-ON-BUGCHK  ALL-BUGCHKS/ALL-BUGINFS commands to allow for
         the dumping of all BUGCHKs and/or all BUGINFs.

      o  INFO% JSYS - Add ENABLE/DISABLE CLUSTER-SENDALLS commands  to
         control    incoming    INFO%   JSYS   TTMSG%   requests   and
         ENABLE/DISABLE CLUSTER-INFORMATION commands  to  control  all
         other incoming INFO% JSYS function requests.

      o  Offline Structures - Add  ENABLE/DISABLE  OFFLINE  STRUCTURES
         commands  to  control  the  state  and  value  of the offline
         structures timeout interval.

      o  Login Structure - Add ENABLE/DISABLE LOGIN-STRUCTURE commands
         to  control if the monitor is to search for a Login Structure
         and to look for dump files on the boot structure (BS:).

      o  Minimum    Password    Length    -     Add     ENABLE/DISABLE
         MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH  commands to allow for the setting of
         the minimum allowable unencrypted user password.

      o  The  error   messages   displayed   were   cleaned   up   and
         standardized.

      o  Rename to 7-SETSPD.EXE.

SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES                                        21 Jun 88


     2.2.2  SYSJOB

     Rename to 7-SYSJOB.EXE.



     2.2.3  CHECKD

     Add  ENABLE/DISABLE  LOGIN-STRUCTURE  commands  to  control   the
     setting  of  Login  Structure  CPU  serial  numbers  in  a  given
     structure's home  blocks.   Also  add  the  SHOW  LOGIN-STRUCTURE
     commands to display the setting of these serial numbers.



     2.2.4  IPALOD

     Version 733 of the CI-20 microcode.  Maintenance edits only.



     2.2.5  KNILDR

     Version 172 of the NI-20 microcode.  Maintenance edits only.



     2.2.6  TGHA

     Change to look for the history  and  trace  data  base  files  on
     TGHA-DATA:, which is now defined by the monitor at system startup
     to be BS:<SYSTEM>.



     2.2.7  ACTGEN

     Change to write ACCOUNTS-TABLE.BIN to BS:<SYSTEM>.



     2.2.8  CHKPNT

     Change to look for the SYSTEM-DATA.BIN file on  BS:   instead  of
     PS:.



     2.2.9  DLUSER

     Add the /FORCE switch to the LOAD command to instruct DLUSER  not
     to  turn  on the CD%NCE bit in the argument block to CRDIR%.  The
     use of this switch causes DLUSER to change directory  information
     for directories that already exist.

     2.3  GALAXY Features

          The following is a list of changes made to GALAXY components
     during TOPS-20 release 7 development.



     2.3.1  NEBULA

     This is a new GALAXY component that is used to implement  cluster
     GALAXY  commands.   NEBULA  maintains DECnet connections to other
     TOPS-20 release 7 nodes in a CFS cluster.   Messages  are  routed
     between  adjacent NEBULAs to allow OPR commands to be extended to
     function throughout the CFS cluster.  The following changes  have
     been made to OPR:

      o  Cluster-wide structure DISMOUNTs can be  performed  from  any
         one system in the cluster.

      o  SHOW commands are extended to return information from any  or
         all  nodes  in  the  cluster  via  use  of the /CLUSTER-NODE:
         switch.

      o  The SHOW CLUSTER-GALAXY-LINK-STATUS has been  added  to  show
         the  state  of  NEBULA  connections  to  other  nodes  in the
         cluster.

      o  The ENABLE/DISABLE  DECNET-CONNECTION-ATTEMPTS  commands  are
         added to control NEBULA connections to other nodes.

      o  The ENABLE/DISABLE  REPORT-CONNECTION-FAILURES  commands  are
         added  to  control  the  OPR  messages  displayed when NEBULA
         connection attempts fail.

      o  The ENABLE/DISABLE LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS commands are
         added  to control the printing of batch log and spooled files
         on selected local printers.

      o  The  ENABLE/DISABLE  PRINT-LOGFILES  commands  are  added  to
         select  which local printers will print batch log and spooled
         files

      o  The                                            ENABLE/DISABLE
         UNPRIVILEGED-USER-ENTIRE-REMOTE-OUTPUT-DISPLAY  commands  are
         added to control what an unprivileged user can  see  when  he
         does an INFORMATION OUTPUT-REQUESTS/DESTINATION:  command for
         the print request queue on a remote node in the cluster.

      o  SEND ALL command can send to other nodes in the  cluster  via
         use of the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.

      o  The SET STRUCTURE str:   EXCLUSIVE  command  will  cause  the
         given  structure  to  be dismounted on all other CFS nodes in
         the cluster.




     2.3.2  SEMI-OPR

     SEMI-OPR is an alternate mode of execution for the  OPR  program.
     Users  without  OPERATOR  privs, but with SEMI-OPERATOR privs get
     the SEMI-OPR> prompt when they run  OPR.EXE.   In  this  mode  of
     operator,  OPR  will  display  only a subset of the OPR commands.
     These are the commands that manipulate the devices.  When  GALGEN
     is run, the commands available to SEMI-OPERATORs can be selected.
     Also, in OPERATOR mode, OPR has two new commands that can be used
     to  control the state of SEMI-OPERATORs.  They are ENABLE/DISABLE
     SEMI-OPR.



     2.3.3  Cluster Printing

     New support in LPTSPL will allow one system's print  requests  to
     be  routed to another node's physical printer in the CFS cluster.
     The system where the printer is located must be  running  LISSPL,
     in  addition  to  LPTSPL, to receive the print request from other
     nodes.  Such a printer is started on the local system via the OPR
     command:

     START (object) PRINTER CLUSTER (unit number) n NODE node::

     where n is a unit number and node::  is the name of the node with
     the  physical  printer.   Print  requests  are  directed  to this
     printer via the /DESTINATION-NODE:  switch on  the  EXEC'S  PRINT
     command.  The OPR ROUTE command can also be used.



     2.3.4  TTY Printing

     LPTSPL now supports spooling to TTY devices.  Such a  printer  is
     started via the OPR command:

     START (object) PRINTER n /DEVICE:TTYnnn: /TERMINAL-CHARACTERISTIC:

     where n is a unit number, TTYnnn:  is a TTY device specification.
     The /TERMINAL-CHARACTERISTICS:  switch is required to select mode
     setting for the terminal.   Requests  can  be  directed  to  this
     printer via the PRINT command's /UNIT:  switch.

     2.3.5  LAT Printing

     LPTSPL now supports printing to LAT ports  or  services.   LPTSPL
     uses the LATOP% extensions that have been added to the monitor to
     spool to this type of printer.  Such a printer is started via the
     OPR command:

     START (object) PRINTER LAT PORT port_name SERVER server_name

     where port_name and server_name identify the LAT printer or

     START (object) PRINTER LAT SERVICE service_name SERVER server_name

     where service_name and server_name identify the LAT printer.  The
     START command also accepts the /TERMINAL-CHARACTERISTICS:  switch
     as described above.   Requests  are  directed  to  this  type  of
     printer    via   the   PRINT   command's   /REMOTE-PRINTER:    or
     /DESTINATION-NODE:  switches.



     2.3.6  DQS Printing

     LPTSPL now supports client mode operation of a DQS spooler.  This
     allows  print  requests  to be directed to a DECnet node which is
     running DQS server software (usually a  VMS  systems),  which  is
     available separately from TOPS-20.  Such a DQS printer is started
     via the OPR command:

     START (object) PRINTER DQS queue_name NODE node_name::

     where queue_name is a remote DQS queue name and node_name::  is a
     remote  DQS  server  node.   Print  requests are directed to this
     printer   via   the   PRINT   command's   /REMOTE-PRINTER:     or
     /DESTINATION-NODE:  switches.



     2.3.7  GALGEN Questions

     New questions have been added to GALGEN.  These questions are  of
     three types:

     1.  Cluster Operator Options

          o  Do you want to ENABLE Cluster GALAXY at GALAXY startup?

          o  Do you wish NEBULA to run as a system process?

          o  Cluster LPTSPL shared directory logical name?

          o  Number of LISSPL server forks?


     3.  SEMI-OPR Device Manipulation Options

         1.  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the printer?

         2.  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the plotter?

         3.  Do you want semi-OPR to  be  able  to  control  the  card
             reader?

         4.  Do you want semi-OPR to  be  able  to  control  the  card
             punch?

         5.  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the paper tape
             punch?

         6.  Do you want semi-OPR to  be  able  to  control  the  tape
             drive?





     2.3.8  Dump On BUGCHK Support

     MOUNTR will now  control  the  setting  of  the  Dump  on  BUGCHK
     structure  dumpable bit in it's data base.  To set this bit for a
     structure, use the

     SET STRUCTURE str:  DUMPABLE

     OPR command and to clear it use the

     SET STRUCTURE str:  NONDUMPABLE

     OPR command.



     2.3.9  LCP Support

     Three changes have been made to LCP.  They are:

     1.  SHOW SESSIONS

         This command will now display the port name  associated  with
         the   listed   sessions.    If   the  session  represents  an
         application terminal, it is so noted.

     2.  SHOW PENDING-REQUESTS

         This new command is used to  display  the  status  of  queued

         requests  for LAT application terminals.  It displays the job
         number,  the  request  status,  the  requested  server  name,
         service name, port name, and the requesting username.

     3.  SHOW HOST-INITIATED-REQUESTS

         This  new  command  is  used  to  display   the   status   of
         host-initiated  requests  for  LAT application terminals.  It
         displays the job status, the requested server  name,  service
         name, port name, and the requesting username.




     2.4  EXEC Features

          The following list details the EXEC commands that have  been
     modified or added for TOPS-20 release 7.



     2.4.1  SET REMOTE-PRINTING

     This new command is used  to  define  and  undefine  alias  names
     associated   with  remote  printers  (LAT  or  DQS)  and  to  set
     characteristics for  use  with  those  printers.   It  has  three
     options:

      o  PRINTER - Accepts arguments to set  up  or  to  remove  alias
         names associated with remote LAT or DQS printers.

      o  CHARACTERISTICS - Sets up characteristics names which can  be
         used with the /CHARACTERISTIC:  switch to the print commands.

      o  SYSTEM-DEFINITIONS  -  Executes  commands   from   the   file
         SYSTEM:REMOTE-PRINTING.CMD.   This  file can be used to setup
         system-wide defaults for remote printing characteristics  and
         printer names.




     2.4.2  PRINT

     The PRINT command has two new switches added to it:

      o  /CHARACTERISTICS:  - Used to specify  characteristics  for  a
         DQS  print request.  These characteristics must be previously
         defined via the SET REMOTE-PRINTING CHARACTERISTICS command.

      o  /REMOTE-PRINTER:  - Used to identify  a  remote  LAT  or  DQS
         printer.   These  printers  must be previously identified via
         the SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER command.

     2.4.3  INFORMATION REMOTE-PRINTING

          This command is used to show the remote printer aliases  and
     characteristics  that  have  been  setup  for  this  job  via SET
     REMOTE-PRINTING commands.



     2.4.4  /DESTINATION-NODE:  Switch

     The /DESTINATION-NODE:  switch has been added for the INFORMATION
     OUTPUT-REQUESTS  command  and  the CANCEL command.  The node name
     specified with this switch now refers to either the local node or
     a remote node in the cluster.



     2.4.5  SYSTAT

     The SYSTAT command has  a  new  option  to  specify  cluster-wide
     information.   It is the NODE option/subcommand.  The NODE option
     allows a user to specify another node or all  nodes  in  the  CFS
     cluster.  SYSTAT information will be returned for other nodes and
     the node name the job is logged in on will be  displayed  in  the
     new NODE column.



     2.4.6  ^ESEND And SEND

     The two SEND commands have been  modified  to  take  an  optional
     /NODE:   switch.   This  switch  specifies  which node in the CFS
     cluster the user or terminal number specified is  logged  in  on.
     The  ^ESEND  command  allows privileged users to specify * as the
     node name.  In this case, the EXEC  will  look  up  the  user  or
     terminal  on any node in the cluster.  If the user or terminal is
     found on multiple nodes, the EXEC will  query  the  user  with  a
     choice of node names.



     2.4.7  ^ESET

     Four new options  have  been  added  to  the  EXEC's  ^ESET  [NO]
     commands.  They are:

     1.  OFFLINE-STRUCTURES

         If "NO" was specified, takes no arguments  and  disables  the
         offline  structures feature.  Otherwise, it accepts a timeout
         interval in the form "mm:ss" or carriage return which default
         the  timeout  interval to 5 seconds.  Legal timeout intervals
         are in the range 00:01 to 15:00.

     2.  CLUSTER-SENDALLS

         If "NO" was specified, disallows  cluster-wide  TTMSG%  sends
         from  being  received  on  the  local system.  Otherwise, the
         sends are allowed.

     3.  CLUSTER-INFORMATION

         If "NO" was specified, prohibits cluster-wide INFO%  requests
         from  being  answered  by  the  local  system.  Otherwise, it
         allows such requests.

     4.  MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH

         If "NO" was specified, then  there  is  no  minimum  password
         length restriction.  Otherwise, all subsequently entered user
         passwords specified  during  directory  creation/manipulation
         must be of the length specified.




     2.4.8  DELETE

     The following subcommands have been added to the DELETE  command.
     These  subcommands  are used to specify which files in the DELETE
     command file specification should actually be deleted.

      o  LARGER - Files  with  a  page  size  larger  than  the  value
         specified will be considered for deletion.

      o  SMALLER - Files with a  page  size  smaller  than  the  value
         specified will be considered for deletion.

      o  BEFORE - Files written before the given date and time will be
         considered for deletion.

      o  AFTER - Files written after the given date and time  will  be
         considered for deletion.




     2.4.9  BUILD And ^ECREATE

     A new subcommand is added to these commands to set  SEMI-OPERATOR
     privs for a given directory.
