MONSYM.DOC
January 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

MONSYM is a file containing all of the definitions relevant to monitor
calls  (JSYSes),  their  arguments and values.  It is normally used in
its .UNV form when assembling TOPS-20 machine language programs.   The
.REL   form   may   be   loaded   with  any  program  to  provide  all
monitor-related symbols for debugging.

MONSYM is not an executable program.  Its definitions reflect  TOPS-20
Release 4, and it may be assembled by and used with MACRO version 53A.

MONSYM does not require other software components.

MONSYM contains definitions of symbols  found  in  the  Monitor  Calls
Reference  Manual.   A listing of MONSYM itself is occasionally useful
to the machine language  programmer  as  a  concise  specification  of
monitor call formats.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

There are no external changes in MONSYM for Release 4.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  MONSYM does not presently define all fields and arguments  of
         all  monitor calls.  Where the Monitor Calls Reference Manual
         does not show a symbol for a particular field or argument, no
         such definition exists in MONSYM.

     2.  MONSYM.MAC  and  MONSYM.UNV  may  only  be  used  with  MACRO
         assemblies  no  equivalent  files  are  available  for  other
         translators.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed for MONSYM Use

     MONSYM.UNV - Universal file for MACRO assemblies
     MONSYM.REL - MONSYM definitions for loading with LINK
MONSYM.DOC                                                      Page 3


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing MONSYM

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 2
     RESTORE <*>MONSYM.* (TO) SYS*.*.-1
     REWIND


4.3  Files Needed to Build MONSYM

     MONSYM.MAC
     MONSYM.CTL
     REL1.MAC


4.4  Instructions for Building MONSYM

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 3
     RESTORE <*>*.* (TO) <self>*.*
     REWIND
     ^C
     SUBMIT MONSYM/TIME:1:0:0

This will run a batch job which builds the .UNV and .REL files.   When
the  job  is  completed,  the  log file should be checked for assembly
errors.  If there are none, the files MONSYM.UNV and MONSYM.REL should
be renamed into SYS:  by the commands:

     @RENAME MONSYM.UNV (TO) SYS:MONSYM.UNV
     @RENAME MONSYM.REL (TO) SYS:MONSYM.REL


4.5  Special Considerations

MONSYM is not an excutable program.  Hence, there is no .EXE  file  of
it ever created.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to MONSYM.TCO for detailed information about changes.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

The following suggestions are being considered for a future release of
MONSYM:

     1.  Include definitions  for  all  remaining  monitor  calls  and
         arguments.

     2.  Support other implementation languages, e.g., BLISS.
