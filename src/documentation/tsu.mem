                     Advice for Current Autopatch Users



   TOPS-10/TOPS-20 Software Update differs from  the  Automatic  Patching
   process in several significant areas.

   Autopatch used a database to track updates to products.  Patch  files,
   which  sometimes  were complete product replacements, were applied and
   an updated product was built  and  installed.   TSU  replaces  updated
   components   in   product   sets   that  are  based  on  the  original
   distribution.   The  TSU  process  does  not  include  the   building,
   installation,  or  backup of any products; in most cases, the products
   are delivered "ready-to-run".

   The TSU process is a static retrieval process  based  on  the  use  of
   logical names.  A logical name is used for each set of files that were
   distributed in a saveset on the product distribution  tape.   In  most
   cases,  these  savesets  distinguish  the  files  as either associated
   documentation files,  product  source  files,  or  product  executable
   files.

   Eliminating the product build process makes the update simpler and, in
   most  cases,  faster.   If  you  do  not  need  to  rebuild any of the
   products, you can indicate that updated executable files only  are  to
   be  restored.   If,  for  any reason, you need to rebuild a product or
   products, you may indicate that source updates are  desired  and  then
   use the build procedures that may be specific to your site.

   If, for any reason, you do  not  want  to  use  the  original  product
   distribution as the base for the TSU process, you may use your current
   Autopatched files on disk.  Refer to Appendix B for instructions to do
   this.

                                INTRODUCTION                                INTRODUCTION



   TOPS-10/TOPS-20 Software Update (TSU) is  a  combination  of  software
   tools  and  operational  procedures  for  easily  installing pre-built
   sources, executables, and updates to the supported  software  products
   developed for DIGITAL's 36-bit operating systems, TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.

   TSU is designed to be an automatic process.  Once the  software  tools
   are  installed  at  your  site, you will be able to install the latest
   versions of DIGITAL's software with little effort.

   The TSU process is based  on  the  original  distribution  of  TOPS-10
   Version  7.04  and  TOPS-20 Versions 4.1 and 7.0.  The TSU update tape
   looks  like  an  all-product  distribution  tape  with  the  following
   exceptions:

         o  Only the files for those products  that  have  changed  since
            last product release are distributed.

         o  Unbundled product files are encrypted and must  be  decrypted
            using separately distributed keyfiles.

         o  Files that are new with each tape are duplicated in a  single
            saveset near the beginning of the first tape.

   Before installing and using the tools provided on the update tape, you
   should  verify  that  you have the system requirements for updating at
   your site.



   1.1  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS   1.1  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   TSU can be used on all supported configurations  of  DECsystem-10  and
   DECSYSTEM-20  hardware  that  have  sufficient  on-line  mass storage.
   Table 1-1 lists the minimum resources required in order to update your
   system using the procedures outlined in this guide.

   1.2  UPDATE TAPE STRUCTURE   1.2  UPDATE TAPE STRUCTURE

   The update tape is organized into several savesets.  A  saveset  is  a
   group  of  files  on tape, stored as the result of one SAVE command to
   either BACKUP (TOPS-10) or DUMPER (TOPS-20).



   1.2.1  Current Update Saveset   1.2.1  Current Update Saveset

   The first saveset contains files used by TSU and information about the
   current  update.   The most important files in this set are listed and
   described in  Table  1-2.   Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  files  are
   provided for TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 systems.

                 build  the  updating  directories  needed  for  the  TSU
                 process.

   LODxxx.CTL    Distribution Retrieval Files.   These files are named in
                 the  format LODxxx where "xxx" indicates a product name.
                 For example,  LODCBL.CTL is the  Distribution  Retrieval
                 File for COBOL.  Use these files to restore the software
                 from the original product distribution tapes to disk.

   COPYAP.CTL    Autopatch Retrieval File.   This file is provided in the
                 event  that original product distribution  tapes are not
                 available for your use.  It is recommended that you make
                 every effort to use the software on the original product
                 distribution  tapes  as  the  base  for the TSU process.
                 However,  if this  is  not possible, you  may  use  your
                 current Autopatched  files.   Use  this control  file to
                 copy  the files  from your Autopatching directories into
                 the TSU directories.

   TSU.NUL       Logical Definition File.   This file is shipped with the
                 extension  .NUL to prevent rewriting an existing Logical
                 Definition file.  You  will rename it with the extension
                 .CMD (TOPS-20) or .MIC (TOPS-10) after restoring it from
                 the  update  tape.  Definitions in  this  file determine
                 what software will be copied from the update tape.

   BACKUP.EXE    The  versions of  BACKUP (TOPS-10)  and DUMPER (TOPS-20)
   DUMPER.EXE    used by  the  Retrieval Process Control files.  Commands
                 to these versions of  BACKUP and  DUMPER are included in
                 the control files.

   TSUNEW.CTX    Retrieval  Process  Control  Files.   These   files  are
   TSUALL.CTX    shipped with the extension .CTX to prevent rewriting any
                 existing  Retrieval  Process  Control  Files.  You  will
                 rename  them  with the  proper extensions  (.CTL)  after
                 restoring  them  from  the  update  tape.  The Retrieval
                 Process   Control  Files  contain  commands  to   BACKUP
                 (TOPS-10) or  DUMPER  (TOPS-20)  to  restore the updated

   APUTIL.EXE    APUTIL is a program that decrypts and verifies software.
                 Commands to APUTIL to  decrypt  and  verify the software
                 are  included  in  the Retrieval Process  Control Files.
                 APUTIL  can also be used  interactively.  See  Chapter 6
                 for information about APUTIL.

   1.2.2  Subsequent Savesets   1.2.2  Subsequent Savesets

   The savesets following the Current Update Saveset contain the  updated
   files for those products that have changed since the last update tape.
   They are grouped together in one saveset.  You can restore these files
   by using the Retrieval Process Control File TSUNEW.CTL.

   All other savesets contain  the  files  for  all  products  that  have
   changed  since  the last product release.  You can restore these files
   by using the Retrieval Process Control File TSUALL.CTL.



   1.3  DISTRIBUTION OF UPDATE TAPES   1.3  DISTRIBUTION OF UPDATE TAPES

   Additional update tapes will be made available to you periodically, as
   changes  are  made  to  the  software.   Each tape contains the latest
   versions of all software products, so that you can update any software
   product at any time.



   1.4  THE UPDATE ENVIRONMENT   1.4  THE UPDATE ENVIRONMENT

   Before you can update the software on  your  system,  you  must  first
   prepare   an  appropriate  environment,  consisting  of  several  disk
   directories.  Then you  will  restore  the  files  from  the  original
   product distribution tapes.  You only need to set up these directories
   and restore the original product distribution files once, because they
   are  to  be retained on disk and used whenever you want to update your
   software.  Directions for preparing your system for the update process
   can  be  found in Chapter 2 if you are preparing a TOPS-10 system.  If
   you are  preparing  a  TOPS-20  system,  you  will  find  the  TOPS-20
   directions in Chapter 4.

   process  so  that  you  need  to  mount  only  one  disk  pack to have
   everything you need.  Our examples refer to  this  disk  structure  as
   TSU:.

   It is also recommended that you use the naming conventions used in the
   procedures,  so  that  your  names  and those used by both TSU and the
   sample procedures shown in this guide will be compatible.   Conforming
   to  the  naming  conventions  will  allow  you  to update the software
   products in use at your site simply by  executing  the  procedures  as
   shown.



   1.5  THE UPDATE PROCESS   1.5  THE UPDATE PROCESS

   The update process is initiated by using BACKUP  (TOPS-10)  or  DUMPER
   (TOPS-20)  to  obtain  the  necessary files from the update tape.  All
   activities are then controlled by  either  of  the  Retrieval  Process
   Control Files.

        1.  Restore the files from the first saveset on the  update  tape
            to  the  updating  directory  on  disk  so that all the files
            needed for the automatic update process are accessible.  Read
            README.nn.

   Before you can update the software on your system,  you  must  prepare
   the  appropriate environment.  To prepare the appropriate environment,
   you will:

        1.  Run CREDIR to create the updating directory.

        2.  Mount the first update tape and restore the Current Update
            Saveset.

        3.  Print and read the README file, if you have not already done
            so.

        4.  Rename the Retrieval Process Control Files and the Logical
            Definition File.

        5.  Edit the Logical Definition File.

        6.  Restore the files from the original product distribution
            tapes to the TSU directories.

   If you have already used TOPS-10/TOPS-20 Software Update once, or have
   already prepared your system, go on to Chapter 3.

   In the steps that follow, anything that you are expected  to  type  is
   underscored;  anything  that  the  system  prints  back  to you is not
   underscored.


   Step 1: Log in under [1,2].

   Note:  You must be logged in to [1,2] for the procedure to work.

   Step 2: Mount the updating structure.

   Mount the structure to be used for  all  the  operations  involved  in
   updating.   To  be  consistent  with our examples, call this structure
   TSU:.  It should be a dedicated disk so that others  can  continue  to
   use the system as you process new update tapes.

   Step 4: Create the updating directory.

   If you already have a User File Directory (UFD)  established  for  the
   updating  directory,  skip this step.  Otherwise, run CREDIR to create
   the UFD for the updating process.  This directory will be TSU:[10,7].

   Step 5: Select a tape drive and SET it available.

   Ensure that the tape drive you will use is available to the  Mountable
   Device Allocator (MDA) by using the OPR command SET TAPE-DRIVE.

   MTA0 is used in the following examples; if the update  tape  is  on  a
   different drive, use the correct physical device name.

   The Current Update Saveset is the first  saveset  on  the  tape.   The
   files  on  the  tape  are restored from the directories on tape to the
   directories you have created on disk.  Only one  saveset  is  restored
   for  each  RESTORE command given.  Each file restored is listed, until
   the end of the saveset is reached.

   Step 10: PRINT the README file.

   Print the documentation file README.nn., where "nn" is the  number  of
   the current update tape.  This file contains summary information about
   the first saveset, and is to be printed and used in  conjunction  with
   this guide.  In the following example .01 is used, but remember to use
   the number of the current update tape.

   Step 11: RENAME the Retrieval Process Control Files  and  the  Logical
            Definition File.

   The Retrieval Process Control Files and the  Logical  Definition  File
   are  shipped  with the file extensions .CTX and .NUL.  These files are
   included in the Current Update Saveset, which you restored in Step  8.
   Rename  these  files  to  include the correct extension:  .CTL for the
   Retrieval  Process  Control  Files  and  and  .MIC  for  the   Logical
   Definition File.

   Rename the control files:

        Files renamed:
        TSU:TSU.NUL

        .


   Step 12: Edit the Logical Definition File (TSU.MIC).

   The Logical Definition File contains directory  definitions  for  each
   product  that  can  be  delivered on an update tape.  As supplied, the
   Logical Definition File points all product files to a nonexistant area
   (NUL:).   Edit  this file to point to existing disk areas ONLY for the
   updated products you want.

   Before editing, the Logical Definition File contains definitions  that
   look like this:

        .PATH/CREATE:NUL:

        .ASSIGN NUL: TSU704:
        .ASSIGN NUL: TSUDEC:
           ;
        ; If [10,7,*,*,*] is not where you want DECNET and the TOPS-10
        ; bundled components, a change is required to the 
        ; TSUNEW.CTL and TSUALL.CTL files.
        ;
        .PATH CBLSYS:=NUL:[10,7,CBLSYS]        ;COBOL executable files
        .PATH CBLSRC:=NUL:[10,7,CBLSRC]        ;COBOL source files

                .
                .

        .PATH/LIST:ALL

   Use the editor of your choice to edit the file to point to the product
   subdirectories  for  only those products that you want to update.  You
   do not have to use the [10,7] PPN for the updating directory.  If  you
   want to use a different PPN, edit the file to include the PPN you want
   to use.

   In the following example, the same locations  shown  above  have  been


                                    2-5

                .
                .

        .PATH/LIST:ALL

   Now copy TSU.MIC to a structure listed in the  standard  login  search
   list for [1,2].


   Step 13: RESTORE files from the original product distribution tapes.

   The original  distribution  provides  the  base  for  the  new  update
   process.   Control  files  are provided to assist you in restoring the
   files from the distribution tapes.  You restored these files when  you
   restored the contents of the Current Update Saveset.


                                   Note:

        If, for  any  reason,  you  must  use  the  files  from  the
        Autopatch areas, see Appendix B for an alternate method.


   Table 2-1 lists each  distribution  tape,  the  name  of  the  product
   contained  on  the  tape,  and  the name of the control file that will
   restore the files.  Refer to the table and, for each product that  you
   want  to  restore, put the tape on drive MTA0:  and submit the control
   file.

   See Appendix A for an example of how to restore COBOL and SORT.

   Step 7: Run BACKUP to RESTORE the Current Update Saveset to [1,2].

   The Current Update Saveset is the first  saveset  on  the  tape.   The
   files  on  the  tape  are restored from the directories on tape to the
   directories you have created on disk.  Only one  saveset  is  restored
   for  each  RESTORE command given.  Each file restored is listed, until
   the end of the saveset is reached.

   Use  TSUNEW.CTL  to  retrieve updated software from the NEW saveset on
   the update tape.  The  NEW  saveset  contains  only  those  files  for
   products  that  are  newly  updated  for the current update tape.  Use
   TSUNEW.CTL only if you are up-to-date as of the previous update  tape.
   Use  the other control file, TSUALL.CTL, to restore the latest version
   of ALL products updated since the last product release.

   Check the log file for errors.  This file will be named TSUNEW.LOG  or
   TSUALL.LOG,  depending  on  the  control file you used.  If any errors
   have occurred, you can use APUTIL interactively to decrypt and  verify
   a specific product.  See Chapter 6 for a description of APUTIL.


   Step 11: Build the TOPS-10 monitor.

                _______  ________  ____________  _____   Refer to the TOPS-10  Software  Installation  Guide,  Chapter  9,  for
   information  on  building  your  monitor.   Chapter 9 describes how to
   build your monitor using the MONitor GENerator program, MONGEN.


   Step 12: Rebuild software.

   If you restored  source  files  because  your  site  uses  nonstandard
   versions  of  the  software, you must accomplish two steps in order to
   incorporate the changes specific to your site.  First, you compare the
   updated  sources with your site's edited sources.  Then, merge the two
   sources together.  After you have compared and merged the sources, you
   can rebuild the product.  Use the procedures that are specific to your
   site or refer to the appropriate product manuals for  instructions  on
   building a specific product.

   Step 13: Copy updated software to system areas.

   The updated software is available in the updating directory and can be

   ____________  _____   Installation  Guide,  Chapter  7,  for  instructions  on  copying  the
   software.

   Before copying it, however, you may want to try running it out of  the
   updating   directory   to   determine  whether  it  performs  to  your
   satisfaction.

   If you are going to copy the updated files now, you must be careful to
   avoid  interfering  with  the  work others are doing if your system is
   running under timesharing.

   Follow the procedures in this chapter to prepare your system  for  the
   TSU  process.   Before you can update the software on your system, you
   must prepare the appropriate environment.  To prepare the environment,
   you will:

        1.  Build the updating directory.

        2.  Mount the first update tape and restore the Current Update
            Saveset.

        3.  Print and read the README file, if you have not already done
            so.

        4.  Rename the Retrieval Process Control Files and the Logical
            Definition File.

        5.  Edit the Logical Definition File.

        6.  Build the updating subdirectories.

        7.  Restore the files from the original product distribution
            tapes to the TSU directories.

   If you have already used TOPS-10/TOPS-20 Software Update once, or have
   already prepared your system, go on to Chapter 5.

   In the steps that follow, anything that you are expected  to  type  is
   underscored;  anything  that  the  system  prints  back  to you is not
   underscored.


   Step 1: Log in to a privileged account.

   You may log  in  to  any  account  having  WHEEL  or  OPERATOR  access
   privileges.  Once you have logged in, enable these privileges.

   Step  2: Prepare  a  disk  structure  to  be  used  for  all  updating
           operations.

   To be consistent with our examples,  call  this  structure  TSU:.   It
   should  be  a  dedicated  disk so that you can continue to update your
   system as new update tapes are distributed.  First, you  must  declare
   TSU: a  domestic structure.  If you are updating the software on a KL,
   you will run OPR; if you are updating the software on a KS,  you  must
   edit  your PS:<SYSTEM>MOUNTR.CMD file.  If you plan to use an existing
   domestic structure for updating, you can skip this step.

   Step 4: BUILD the updating directory.

   The  updating  directory  is  called  TSU:<UPDATE>.   There  are   two
   different  examples  below, one for a KL and one for a KS.  The number
   of permanent and  working  pages  for  the  KL  is  set  to  INFINITE.
   INFINITE  cannot  be  specified  on  the KS but the same effect can be
   achieved by using 1 billion (1 and nine zeroes).

   Rename  these  files  to  include the correct extension:  .CTL for the
   Retrieval Process Control Files, and .CMD for the  Logical  Definition
   File.

   Rename the control files:

         ______ _____ __________        $RENAME *.CTX *.CTL<RET>
         TSUALL.CTX.1 => TSUALL.CTL.1 [OK]


                                    4-5

         TSUNEW.CTX.1 => TSUNEW.CTL.1 [OK]
        $

   Rename the Logical Definition File:

         ______ _____ __________        $RENAME *.NUL *.CMD<RET>
         TSU.NUL.1 => TSU.CMD.1 [OK]
        $


   Step 13: Edit the Logical Definition File (TSU.CMD).

   The Logical Definition File contains directory  definitions  for  each
   product  that  can  be  delivered on an update tape.  As supplied, the
   Logical Definition File points all product files to a nonexistant area
   (NUL:).   Edit  this file to point to existing disk areas ONLY for the
   updated products you want.

   Before editing, the Logical Definition File contains definitions  that
   look like this:

        DEFINE BP2SYS: NUL:<UPDATE.BP2SYS>        ;BASIC executable files
        DEFINE CBLSYS: NUL:<UPDATE.CBLSYS>        ;COBOL executable files
                .
                .
                .

   Use the editor of your choice to edit the file to point to the product
   subdirectories for only those products that you want to update.

   In the following example, the same locations  shown  above  have  been
   defined.  The locations that have been defined are underlined.

                       ____        DEFINE BP2SYS: TSU:<UPDATE.BP2SYS>   ;BASIC executable files
                       ____        DEFINE CBLSYS: TSU:<UPDATE.CBLSYS>   ;COBOL executable files
                .
                .
                .


   Step 14: Submit BLDTSU.CTL to create the updating subdirectories.

   The Build Control  File  BLDTSU.CTL  is  provided  to  assist  you  in
   creating the updating subdirectories.  BLDTSU.CTL contains commands to
   the monitor to create the subdirectories, set the number of  permanent
   and working pages, and designate the directory group.

   For TOPS-20 KL systems, BLDTSU.CTL uses the definitions  made  in  the
   Logical  Definition  File  (TSU.CMD).   The  TOPS-20 KS system's BUILD
   command, however, does not recognize logical names.  Therefore, if you
   are  preparing  a  KS system for updating, you must edit BLDTSU.CTL to
|  include real structure names.  For those products  that  you  want  to

|  update,  replace  XXX:   with  the  real name of the structure you are
   using for the update process.  In this guide, the structure name  that
   is being used is TSU:.

   The updating subdirectories are named following the convention

        TSU:<UPDATE.subdirectory>

   where "subdirectory" is the name of each product saveset.

   Table 4-1 lists the subdirectories that are  built  when  the  control
   file is submitted.

   The  subdirectories  are  created  with  the  number  of  working  and
   permanent  pages  set  to  INFINITE on the KL and 1 billion on the KS.
   These values were chosen based on the use of a  dedicated  disk  pack.
   If  you  do not dedicate a disk pack to the update process, you may be
   interested in the number of pages  required  for  each  product.   The
   approximate  numbers  of permanent and working pages required for each
   product are also listed in Table 4-1.  The values listed are  somewhat
   higher  than the actual requirements for the product in order to allow
   additional  space  for  temporary  files  created  during  the  update
   process.

   Step 15: RESTORE files from the original product distribution tapes.

   The original  distribution  provides  the  base  for  the  new  update
   process.   Control  files  are provided to assist you in restoring the
   files from the distribution tapes.  You restored these files when  you
   restored the contents of the Current Update Saveset.


                                   Note:

        If, for any reason, you must use the files  from  your  most
        recent  Autopatch  areas,  see  Appendix  B for an alternate
        method.


   Table 4-2 lists each  distribution  tape,  the  name  of  the  product
   contained  on the tape, the name of the control file that will restore
   the files, and whether the product is KL or KS specific.  Refer to the
   table  and, for each product that you want to restore, put the tape on
   drive MTA0:  and submit the control file.

   Three of the control  files  contain  a  logical  definition  for  the
   structure  and  directory  used  in  the examples.  If you are using a
   structure and directory other than TSU:<UPDATE>, you must  edit  these
   files.   The  files that contain this definition are indicated with an
   *.

   See Appendix A for an example of how to restore BASIC-Plus-2.

   This chapter lists the steps you must follow to update your  software.
   If  you  have just finished setting up your system for the first time,
   go to Step 10.

   If your system is already set up for the TSU  process,  and  you  have
   used this process at least one other time, begin with Step 1.


   Step 1: Log in to a privileged account.

   You may log  in  to  any  account  having  WHEEL  or  OPERATOR  access
   privileges.  Once you have logged in, enable these privileges.

   Ensure that the tape drive you will use  is  available  to  MOUNTR  by
   using the OPR command SET TAPE-DRIVE.

   The Current Update Saveset is the first  saveset  on  the  tape.   The
   files  on  the  tape  are restored from the directories on tape to the
   directories you have created on disk.  Only one  saveset  is  restored
   for  each  RESTORE command given.  Each file restored is listed, until
   the end of the saveset is reached.

   Step 10: Select the desired Retrieval Process Control file (TSUALL.CTL
            or TSUNEW.CTL) to restore updated software.

   You are supplied with two batch control files but will only  use  one.
   Use  TSUNEW.CTL  to  retrieve updated software from the NEW saveset on
   the update tape.  The  NEW  saveset  contains  only  those  files  for
   products  that  are  newly  updated  for the current update tape.  Use
   TSUNEW.CTL only if you are up-to-date as of the previous update  tape.
   Use  the other control file, TSUALL.CTL, to restore the latest version
   of ALL products updated since the last product release.


                                   Note:

        If this is your first time using the  TSU  process  and  you
        have   just   finished   restoring   the   original  product
        distribution files, use the TSUALL.CTL control file.

   If you restored product executable files, go on to Step 12.


   Step 11: Rebuild updated software.

   If your site uses nonstandard  versions  of  the  software,  you  must
   accomplish  two  steps in order to incorporate the changes specific to
   your site.  First, compare the updated sources with your site's edited
   sources.   Then,  merge  the  two  sources  together.   After you have
   compared and merged the sources, you can rebuild the product.  Use the
   procedures  that are specific to your site or refer to the appropriate
   product manuals for instructions on building a specific product.


   Step 12: Copy updated software to system areas.

   The updated software is available in the updating directory and can be
   copied  to the system areas.  Before copying it, however, you may want
   to try running it out of the updating directory to  determine  whether
   it performs to your satisfaction.

   If you are going to copy the updated files now, you must be careful to
   avoid  interfering  with  the  work others are doing if your system is
   running under timesharing.

   6.1  THE APUTIL PROGRAM   6.1  THE APUTIL PROGRAM

   APUTIL is a program for decrypting and verifying the files provided on
   the  TOPS-10/TOPS-20  Software  Update  Tapes.   Commands to APUTIL to
   decrypt and verify software are contained  in  the  Retrieval  Process
   Control  Files that are supplied for the TSU update procedure.  APUTIL
   may also be used interactively.

   TSU uses the tape utilities BACKUP (TOPS-10) and DUMPER  (TOPS-20)  to
   restore  the  files  into  directories created for the update process.
   This operation is controlled by the Retrieval  Process  Control  File.
   The unbundled product files are encrypted and must be decrypted, using
   special key files, after they are restored.  The command to decrypt is
   included  in  the Retrieval Process Control File, so the decryption is
   done automatically as the files are restored.   Each  directory  in  a
   product  saveset  contains  a  Verify  File (.VFY), and each .VFY file
   contains the file specifications and checksums of all  files  in  that
   directory.   The  key file is supplied with each product release tape,
   or as a separate key file distribution.

   APUTIL has five commands:  HELP,  READ,  DECRYPT,  VERIFY,  and  EXIT.
   When  used with the Retrieval Process Control File, commands to APUTIL
   within the file direct APUTIL to READ the .VFY file for  each  product
   and  to  DECRYPT  all files listed there with the product's associated
   key file.  Then, the file is closed.  It is closed with the same  file
   specification  as the original file, including the same version number
   and creation date.  The original encrypted files  are  not  preserved.
   After  the  file is closed, a command to VERIFY compares the checksums
   of all files to the checksums in the .VFY file in order to verify  the
   integrity of the files.

   The .VFY file is a checksummed directory listing.  There is  one  .VFY
   file  for  each  directory  in  the  product  savesets.  The .VFY file
   includes products not changed since distribution.

   6.1.1  The READ Command   6.1.1  The READ Command

   The READ command closes any previously opened .VFY file and then reads
   the  .VFY  file  in  the  specified  directory.   If  no  directory is
   specified, the default is the connected directory.  The  default  file
   extension  is  .VFY.  The .VFY file must be READ before the DECRYPT or
   VERIFY operation can be performed.

   The arguments to the READ command are:  the device, directory and name
   of  the  .VFY  file.  If the device and directory have been assigned a
   logical name, the logical name may be used in place of the device  and
   directory the logical name represents.

   The READ command has the following form:
|  
|       APUTIL>READ device:filename.vfy[directory]
|  or
        APUTIL>READ logicalname:filename.vfy

   If you wanted to read the  .VFY  file  for  the  IBMCOM/ET  executable
   files, you would type:

   For TOPS-10:
|  
|       APUTIL>READ TSU:IETSYS.VFY[10,7,IETSYS]

   For TOPS-20:

        APUTIL>READ TSU:<UPDATE.IETSYS>IETSYS.VFY

   Or, for both TOPS-10 and TOPS-20:

        APUTIL>READ IETSYS:IETSYS.VFY

   After you issue the command to read IETSYS.VFY, APUTIL sends a message
   to the terminal:

        [Reading TSU:IETSYS.VFY[10,7,IETSYS]]



   6.1.2  The DECRYPT Command   6.1.2  The DECRYPT Command

   The DECRYPT command uses the product key file to decrypt all files for
   a  specific  product.   The  files  to  be decrypted are listed in the
   verify file for the product.  Then, the file is closed, with the  same
   file  specification  as  the original file, including the same version
   number and creation date, and the original, encrypted  files  are  not
   preserved.

   The arguments to the DECRYPT command are:  the device, directory,  and
   name of the .KEY file.  If the device and directory have been assigned


                                    6-2
                                 REFERENCE                                 REFERENCE


   a logical name, that name may be used  in  place  of  the  device  and
   directory as long as the logical name points to only one directory.

   If no directory is specified, DECRYPT uses the directory specified  in
   the previous READ command as the default, and the previously specified
   .VFY file name as the default for the  key  file,  with  .KEY  as  its
   extension.   In  most  cases the key file name will be the same as the
   previously specified .VFY file name.  If it is different,  the  switch
   /KEY  must  be  used  to  specify  the  key file name.  APUTIL sends a
   message to the terminal to show which files are being decrypted.

   The DECRYPT command has the following form:

        APUTIL>DECRYPT device:[directory]
   or
        APUTIL>DECRYPT logicalname:

   Optionally, if the key file name is different from the .VFY file  name
   used in the previous read command:

   For TOPS-10:
|  
|       APUTIL>DECRYPT device:/KEY:keyfilename.key[directory]
|  or
|       APUTIL>DECRYPT logicalname:/KEY:keyfilename.key

   For TOPS-20:

        APUTIL>DECRYPT device:[directory]/KEY:keyfilename.key
   or
        APUTIL>DECRYPT logicalname:/KEY:keyfilename.key

   To decrypt the IBMCOM/ET executable files that have been encrypted:

        APUTIL>DECRYPT IETSYS:

   6.1.3  The VERIFY Command   6.1.3  The VERIFY Command

   The VERIFY command computes  a  standard  18-bit  folded  (sequential)
   checksum for each file in the specified directory and compares it with
   the checksum provided in the .VFY file.

   VERIFY compares the checksums of the files listed  in  the  .VFY  file
   last  read  with  the  checksums  of files in the specified directory.


                                    6-3

   Files must be decrypted before using the VERIFY command, otherwise the
   checksums  will  not  match.  Error messages are issued if any file is
   missing or if  the  checksums  do  not  match.   The  default  is  the
   directory  specified  in the READ or DECRYPT command, whichever is the
   most recent.

   The VERIFY command has the following form:

        APUTIL>VERIFY device:[directory]
   or
        APUTIL>VERIFY logicalname:

   To VERIFY the IBMCOM/ET files just decrypted:

        [Successfully verified n of n files, n errors, n checksum errors]



   6.1.4  The HELP Command   6.1.4  The HELP Command

   HELP prints out the help file HLP:APUTIL.HLP  on  the  terminal.   The
   HELP  command  followed  by a keyword will print out the help text for
   just that keyword.

   For help on all commands, the HELP command has the following form:

        APUTIL>HELP

   For help on just one command, HELP  accepts  the  command  name  as  a
   keyword:

        APUTIL>HELP commandname



   6.1.5  The EXIT Command   6.1.5  The EXIT Command

   The EXIT command closes all opened files and exits to the monitor.  An
   alternate  form  of EXIT is <CTRL/Z>.  This is the standard method for
   terminating a program on TOPS-10, but this feature is not  allowed  on
   TOPS-20.

   This  appendix  contains  examples  showing  you  how   to   use   the
   Distribution  Retrieval  Files.  If you are updating a TOPS-10 system,
   continue with Section A.1.  If you are updating a TOPS-20  system,  go
   on to Section A.2.



   A.1  RESTORING COBOL V12C/SORT V4D   A.1  RESTORING COBOL V12C/SORT V4D

   LODCBL.CTL is the Distribution Retrieval File that  contains  commands
   to restore the files for the products COBOL and SORT from the original
   distribution  tapes  (BB-H580E-SB  and   BB-PANKA-BB)   to   the   TSU
   directories CBLSYS:, CBLSRC:, SRTSYS:, and SRTSRC:.

   Briefly, the control file contains commands to the  monitor  to  mount
   the  first  tape  (BB-H580E-SB)  with  the  reel  ID "TSU," and to run
   BACKUP.  It also contains commands  to  BACKUP  to  restore  files  to
   specific directories, to rewind the tape and to exit to monitor level.
   Once the files from the first tape are restored, commands are given to
   the  monitor  to  dismount the first tape and to mount the second tape
   (BB-PANKA-BB), also with the reel ID "TSU." Again, BACKUP is  run  and
   commands are given to restore files to specific directories, to rewind
   the tape, and to exit to monitor level.   After  the  files  from  the
   second  tape  are  restored,  commands  are  given  to  the monitor to
   dismount the tape, and the procedure is complete.

   A.2  RESTORING BASIC-PLUS-2   A.2  RESTORING BASIC-PLUS-2

   LODBP2.CTL is the Distribution Retrieval File that  contains  commands
   to  restore  the  files for the product BASIC-Plus-2 from the original
   distribution  tape  BB-5543F-BM  to   the   TSU   directory   BP2SYS:.

   LODBP2.CTL also contains commands to restore the BASIC-Plus-2 key file
   from the original distribution tape, BB-PANMA-BM.

   Briefly, the control file contains commands to the  monitor  to  mount
   the  first  tape  (BB-5543F-BM)  and  to run DUMPER.  It also contains
   commands to DUMPER to restore files to specific directories, to rewind
   the  tape and to exit to monitor level.  Once the files from the first
   tape are restored, commands are given to the monitor to  dismount  the
   first  tape and to mount the second tape (BB-PANMA-BM).  Again, DUMPER
   is  run  and  commands  are  given  to  restore  files   to   specific
   directories,  to rewind the tape, and to exit to monitor level.  After
   the files from the second tape are restored, commands are given to the
   monitor to dismount the tape, and the procedure is complete.

   The information in this Appendix is provided  for  those  of  you  who
   choose  to  use your current Autopatched files on disk as the base for
   the TSU process.  In order to use your Autpatched files you must  copy
   them   from   the  old  Autopatching  directories  into  the  new  TSU
   directories.  The control file COPYAP.CTL is provided in  the  Current
   Update  Saveset to facilitate this task.  COPYAP.CTL contains commands
   to copy all the files from the Autopatching directories into  the  TSU
   directories.


                                 Important:

        Please be advised that some of the files that were  included
        in  the  original product distribution were not required for
        Autopatch.  This may result in error messages when verifying
        decrypted  files.   It is likely that the missing files will
        not prevent the decryption  or  operation  of  the  affected
        products,  but you may want to bypass TSU VERIFY processing.
        To  do  this,  edit  the  Retrieval  Process  Control   File
        (TSUNEW.CTL  or  TSUALL.CTL)  before submitting it for batch
        processing.


   There are two tables provided to show you the  correspondance  between
   the  old  Autopatch  directories  and the TSU directories.  If you are
   setting up a TOPS-10 system, refer to Table B-1; if you are setting up
   a TOPS-20 system, refer to Table B-2.
