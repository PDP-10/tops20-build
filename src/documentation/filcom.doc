FILCOM.DOC -- Changes from V21C(75) to V22A(117)
September 1987



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a combination of a maintenance  release  of  FILCOM  with  the
added  support  for  /Offset  mode.   This  release  will  run  on all
supported monitors.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


In /U mode, FILCOM will flag deleted text by a bullet (o) in the  left
margin.

The /O (offset) switch has been added.  If this switch is used  in  an
ASCII, non-/U compare, the location of differences will be reported as
closest label+offset.  This assumes that the source file is a MACRO-10
or  MACRO-11 file, and that labels start in the first 10 characters of
a line.  PDP-11 local labels (nnn$:)  are  qualified  by  the  nearest
ordinary label.

The /T switch has been added.  This switch  causes  FILCOM  to  always
produce  an output file, even if no differences are encountered.  This
is intended for automatic procedures that  assume  that  a  file  will
always  be  created.   Note that /T has always been the default for /U
mode.

FILCOM was comparing too many locations in an EXE  file  compare.   Do
not  compare  locations 0-40, 42, 43, 45-73, 77-111, 113, 114, and 132
inclusive.  Also FILCOM had a bug where it was  erroneously  comparing
location 73.

The /I switch has been added.  This  switch  causes  FILCOM  to  do  a
case-invariant  compare.  That is, files that are identical except for
case will have no differences.  



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are no changes in the installation instructions.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.
Significant Edit #s

76     Add  support  from  ADP  for  /O  -  report   label+offset   in
       differences file.  This is useful for .MAC or .P11 files, since
       it  eliminates  ambiguity  in   reporting   the   location   of
       differences.

100    Don't get confused if someone does a CCL RUN UUO.

101    Improve /U without /L

102    Fix parsing of =[sfd spec],[p,pn<cr><lf>

105    Add /T

113    FILCOM compares too many  job  data  area  locations.   Do  not
       compare  locations  0-40,  42, 43, 45-73, 77-111, 113, 114, and
       132 inclusive.  Also FILCOM had a bug where it was  erroneously
       comparing location 73.

114    Fix apparent fencepost error with /1L.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
