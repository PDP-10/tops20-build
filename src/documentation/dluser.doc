DLUSER.DOC -- Changes from V4(4) to V5(4)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

DLUSER is a program which obtains identifying information  about  each
directory  on  a system and places it in a file.  The program can then
use this file to create the same directories later, in the event of  a
system rebuild.

DLUSER version 5(4) runs on Release 5 of TOPS-20.

DLUSER does not depend on any other software during its execution.

DLUSER is documented in  the  TOPS-20  Operator's  Guide  and  TOPS-20
System Manager's Guide.
