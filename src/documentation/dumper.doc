1.0  SUMMARY

DUMPER is a program for saving and restoring disk files using magtape.
It  is  used  by operations personnel for file system maintenance, and
may be employed by users who wish to keep  certain  files  on  magtape
and/or transfer them between systems.

DUMPER version 6(528) runs on TOPS-20 Release 6.

DUMPER does not require any other software modules during execution.

DUMPER is documented in the TOPS-20 User's Guide, and some  privileged
functions  are  described  in the TOPS-20 Operator's Guide and TOPS-20
System Manager's Guide.

You should read the DUMPER.BWR file.  There are many important changes
to 6(528) that you should be aware of.

2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


  1. The new DUMPER should SAVE files with less CPU use than it used to.
   This shows up especially in /INCREMENTAL and /FULL incremental commands,
   ARCHIVAL, and other "special saves".  CHECK and RESTORE should also be
   faster.

  2. Several new save commands exist.  ARCHIVE is equivalent to SAVE/ARCHIVE,
   and MIGRATE does a SAVE/MIGRATE.

   ABORT, previously mentioned, is available after typing ^E to interrupt a
   command. 

  3. The new TRANSFER command acts like RESTORE, except that the defaults are
   TRANSFER DSK*:<*>*.*.* (as) *.*.*; ie, restore everything from anywhere
   into your connected directory.

  4. The LIST command has two new options, /MAIL and /NOMAIL.  /NOMAIL is the
   default and does a normal LIST file.  /MAIL is used to write the file
   you feed to the new MAIL command.  The /MAIL option makes only small changes
   to the listfile.  The default LIST/MAIL file is DUMPER-MAIL.TXT
   Also, the list file format is slightly cleaner.

  5. The MAIL command will take a file written by LIST/MAIL and send mail to
   the owners of the files mentioned therein.  This takes the place of
   the automatic mail sent by the old version of the Retrieve command; ie,
   you don't have to have the mail if you don't want it.  If you do, you
   would type (before the retrieve) LIST/MAIL and (after the retrieve)
   MAIL.  This command types to the terminal what it sends to each user.
   This mechanism can be used with ANY kind of SAVE and the RETRIEVE command.

  6. Several new NO commands exist, these being the date setting commands
   (ABEFORE, MSINCE, etc), and NO DATES, which clears all the dates at
   once.

  7. At the end of a save command, the CPU time used is printed, for those
   interested in tuning DUMPER.  Timing starts after parsing all filespecs
   in the command line (ie, after the command is confirmed) and continues
   through everything (including pass 2, if one is needed).

  8. A new command, EXACT, is available under conditional assembly. When
   given, the SAVE command will not expand the logical name given
   explicitly as the second filespec (the "as" filespec), as it would
   normally do. This means that, if you have PS: defined to be FOOBAR:,
   in EXACT mode the command SAVE ME:*.* (AS) PS:<YOU>*.* would write
   the files on tape as saved from PS:<YOU>, instead of FOOBAR:<YOU>.
   It has a similiar effect on the first filename in a RESTORE command.

  9. PRINT has gained a /FAST switch.  This tries to write a print file that
   fits in 80 columns/line without losing any information.  Hence, P/F<CR>
   should type a neater list to the terminal.

  10. ^A types out more information than it used to in some cases.  It types
   out the last seen filename on the tape more consistantly than old DUMPER
   did, among other things.

  11. DUMPER has several Feature Test switches that can be used to increase
   its speed or affect other changes.  A list of these, and the ramifications
   of changing them, are listed in DUMPER.BWR.


3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     1.  Reverse SKIPs with labeled tape does not work.

     2.  Interchange tapes written in DUMPER cannot be read  past  the
         first  saveset by BACKUP.  Therefore a restriction of one
         saveset per tape exists.


4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run DUMPER

DUMPER consists of one file, DUMPER.EXE.


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing DUMPER

Mount the tape labeled  Installation  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     SKIP MTA0:5 FILES
     R DUMPER
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>DUMPER.EXE (TO) SYS:*.*.-1
     REWIND


4.3  Files Needed for Build DUMPER

DUMPER is built from the following files:

     DUMPER.MAC
     ARMAIL.MAC

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACSYM.REL
     MONSYM.UNV
     MACSYM.UNV
     QSRMAC.UNV
     GLXMAC.UNV
     ACTSYM.UNV
     ARMAIL.REL


4.4  Instructions for Building DUMPER

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND
     ^C
     SUBMIT DUMPER.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST


     4.5  Special Considerations

     DUMPER is used during the initial phases of system installation
     and file structure refreshing. For this reason, it is advisable
     to have a copy of DUMPER on one or more magtapes. DUMPER may be
     put on magtape by:

     @ASSIGN MTAn:                      ! assign and mount blank tape
     @REWIND MTAn:                      ! put DUMPER at beginning
     @COPY SYS:DUMPER.EXE (TO) MTAn:    ! copy to tape

DUMPER may be loaded and run directly from a magtape generated in this
way.

DUMPER is intended to perform a number of  privileged  functions  when
run  by  operations  personnel,  and its behavior is modified slightly
when running with WHEEL or  OPERATOR  capabilities  enabled.   Consult
TOPS-20  User's  Guide  and  TOPS-20  Operator's  Guide for additional
information.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Refer to the history in DUMPER.MAC for detailed information
about changes, and carefully read DUMPER.BWR as well.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

DUMPER can be customized in various ways to increase its speed.  Notes
on this can be found in DUMPER.MAC.
