CREF.DOC -- Changes from V53(53) to V53B(71)
July 1980



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a maintenance release of CREF, a program  for  generating  cross
reference listings.

Version 53B of CREF must be loaded  with  the  field  image  version  of
HELPER.

CREF version 53B is supported by Digital Equipment Corporation, and runs
on all supported monitors as released.  Version 53B fully supercedes all
previous versions, and includes edits up to #71.

Documentation for using CREF is contained in the help file CREF.HLP, and
in  the  Operating System Commands Manual and the specifications section
of the TOPS-10 Software Notebooks.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

      1.  When a CRLF is typed in response to the CREF prompt "*",  CREF
          will  still search for CREF.CRF but will no longer complain if
          it is not found, it will  simply  reprompt.   If  CREF.CRF  is
          found,  the  file will be processed in the normal way with the
          appropriate messages.

      2.  It is worth noting that CREF should now process  long  symbols
          (i.e.    symbols   of  length  greater  than  six  characters)
          correctly.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

      1.  There are no known bugs in CREF 53B(71) as of 15-Jul-80.

      2.  The command scanner in CREF, which has not been changed  since
          version  53,  still  does  not recognize all the errors a user
          might type.

      3.  The "/R" switch applied to multiple FORTRAN input listings may
          or  may  not  do  what  the user intended.  The meaning of the
          switch in this case is somewhat ambiguous - does the user want
          each separate subroutine to be restarted at the specified line
          or does the user want the line-printer output to be  restarted
          at the physical printed line specified?

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Edit                     Description

54        Allow  differential  line   numbers   to   be   negative,   so
          nonmonotonic  line  numbers  won't  bother CREF.  This removes
          edits 22, 25, 26.

55        Don't eat type-ahead if nothing returned from rescan.

56        Fix CREFing of FAIL output - broken by edit 22.

57        Don't try to put listing creation date in the future.

60        Update copyright date, and release as CREF %53A(60).

61        A null line no longer produces an error message.

62        CREFed long FORTRAN instructions no longer contain garbage.

63        One underbar error message per  command  line  and  no  longer
          caused by SWITCH.INI.

64        Addition to edit 61 for DEC-20s.

65        CREF only sorts first six characters of long symbol names.

66        CREF loops  infinitely  when  handling  symbols  with  leading
          spaces.   Disallow  spaces in symbols (remove them).  Also fix
          edit 62.

67        CREF uses excess CRLFs when CREFing long symbols.

70        Change lowercase symbols to  uppercase  before  converting  to
          sixbit.

71        If a comment line preceeds a CREF line in SWITCH.INI, the CREF
          line will not be read.

CREF.DOC -- Changes from V52(27) to V53(53)
January 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

CREF 53(53) is CREF %52A(27) with a somewhat-enhanced  command  scanning
and  parsing  routine,  plus  general  edits  to  clean  up  the overall
user-interface.  There have been no changes made  to  the  actual  inner
workings of how CREF processes input files to generate the cref listing.

CREF %52A(27) runs on all supported 5 and 6 series monitors  up  to  and
including  6.03.   CREF  53(53)  is  fully  upwards compatible with CREF
%52A(27)  except  for  its  more  stringent  requirements  on   commands
(previous illegal or illogical commands which could slip through earlier
versions will be flagged as errors by this version - also  old  altmodes
are  no  longer  treated  as break characters but rather as normal ASCII
graphic characters;  the "_" character is being phased out and  replaced
by the "=" character).

CREF is documented in Software Notebook Vol. 8.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The major difference between CREF 53(53) and earlier versions of CREF is
in  the  interface  with  the  terminal  user  (typed-in commands, error
messages, etc.).


2.1  The Saved Core Image

CREF %52A(27) had non-zero data in it's low seg and so had a .LOW  file.
Since this can cause lots of unnecessary overhead (forces the monitor to
always go to disk to get the core image rather than being able  to  read
it  directly  off  the swapping area - which is much faster) CREF 53(53)
has moved all this data into it's high seg.


2.2 Typed-In Commands

CREF's command scanner has been enhanced and modified to be more closely
compatible  with  the  rest  of  the  TOPS10  world.   Specifically, the
conventions used by SCAN have been adopted wherever applicable.
CRF53.DOC                                                         Page 6


     1.  Command Syntax

         Many illegal  or  otherwise  illogical  syntaxes  that  earlier
         versions  of  CREF would accept have been dis-allowed.  This in
         no way affects  otherwise  legal  command  constructions.   For
         example  CREF  %52A(27)  would allow you to specify device DSK:
         and ppn [1,2] by typing "DS[1,2]K:" but  the  (legal  to  SCAN)
         command  ".FOO  MUMBLE BLAH:" (to specify file BLAH:MUMBLE.FOO)
         would be interpreted by CREF as meaning FOOMUM:CREF.CRF!

     2.  Old Altmodes

         The ASCII characters - (tilde and right  curly  brace  -  octal
         codes  175  and  176  respectively) are, in keeping with modern
         standards, no longer considered to be break  characters  -  the
         so-called  old  altmodes.   They  are  now  just  2 other ASCII
         printing characters like the  letters  or  "%".   If  the  user
         wishes  to  continue using the (tilde and right curly brace) as
         old altmodes then he may use the monitor command ".TTY ALTMODE"
         to pass them as <ESC> (octal code 33) to his programs.

     3.  Destination - Source Specifier

         In  keeping  with  modern   conventions   the   "_"   character
         (underscore  or  left-arrow - octal code 137) is no longer used
         to delimit the destination or output file specs from the source
         or  input  file  specs.  The user should now use the "=" (equal
         sign, octal code 075) for this purpose.  The "_"  character  is
         dedicated  to use in network node specifications.  For the time
         being, CREF will continue  to  accept  "_"  but  will  issue  a
         warning message to annoy you.

     4.  Default PPN Specifications

         You may now type constructs like "[,] or "[,4321]" (i.e.,  null
         project  or  programmer  fields) to specify default (logged-in)
         ppn attributes.  "[-]" means use the job's default  path.   SFD
         fields  in  the  path  specification may not be left null.  The
         trailing "]" is needed only if further file specs follow  which
         need to be delimited from the path specification.

     5.  Random Illegal Control Characters

         Characters such as Control-A or Control-F are no longer allowed
         (Syntax error) in command strings.
CRF53.DOC                                                         Page 7


     6.  Comments

         The ";" (semicolon) character is now recognized  as  a  comment
         character.   When  a  ";"  is  encountered in the command input
         stream then it and all text up to the next break character will
         be  ignored.   Note that the sometimes comment character "!" is
         still used for specifying a "RUN" command  to  the  file  whose
         file specs it terminates.

     7.  Continuation

         Following SCAN's conventions, if a "-" character  is  the  last
         non-blank  non-comment character on a command line then both it
         and the break character (and any comments) will be ignored  and
         CREF  will  continue  to  accept command input.  If the command
         device is the user TTY and a line of input has not already been
         typed (as in typed ahead) then CREF will output a "#" character
         to prompt you.

     8.  SFD's

         CREF 53(53) will now accept SFD path specifications in all file
         path specs.  Null SFD's are illegal.

     9.  Command Files

         CREF will now recognize the "@" character as meaning  that  the
         current  file  specs  are  to be treated as an indirect command
         file.  The "@" may appear anywhere in the file  specs.   If  an
         indirect  command  file is to be used then it must be the first
         set of file specs on that command  line  (everything  following
         will be ignored).

    10.  CCL Entry and the Monitor CREF Command

         The user may now type optional arguments to  the  CREF  monitor
         command.   If no arguments are specified then the command works
         just as it did with earlier versions.   The  arguments  may  be
         either  CREF  switches  or  file  specifications (with optional
         switches).

         If the user specifies just CREF switches in  the  CREF  command
         (e.g.,  ".CREF/O/R") then those switches will be remembered and
         applied to all files being processed in the current CCL request
         (typically following a COMPILE/CREF monitor command).

         If the user types  file  specifications  in  the  CREF  command
         (e.g.,   ".CREF  LPT0:=BLAH/P")  then  the  rest  of  the  line
         following the "CREF" command will be treated as if the user had
         first  typed  ".R  CREF"  then  typed  the  rest of the command
         ("LPT0:=BLAH/P").  After the command has  been  processed  CREF
         will  exit  -  no  attempt  will  be  made to also look for CCL
         command files to read.
CRF53.DOC                                                         Page 8


2.3  Multiple Input Files

When multiple input files are specified to CREF all files in the command
string  (the input files of course) will now be deleted.  Formerly, only
the last file specified got deleted.  Due  to  the  vagaries  of  CREF's
command  scanner  all  processing  switches (e.g., "/O" or "/K") must be
given no later than the first input file spec.  Switches  such  as  "/A"
and  "/B" work on the indivividual file spec to which they are attached.
Note especially that to preserve  the  input  files  (if  they  are  not
otherwise  protected  against  being  deleted)  the  "/P" switch must be
specified no later than the first complete file spec!

One other thing the user should be aware of is  that  if  CREF  finds  a
syntax  error  in  the  command  string  (e.g., ".DSK:") then the entire
command will be aborted - any files that have already been processed for
that  command  will  have been deleted, and the output will be lost (the
user will have to regenerate the input .CRF files again).


2.4  Error Message Typeout

The handling of error messages by CREF has been cleared up  somewhat  to
provide  a  nicer  and more consistent error facility, again maintaining
compatibility with SCAN.

     1.  Upper/Lower Case

         All error messages now appear in the  standard  DEC  format  of
         leading   character   ["?",   "%",  or  "["]  followed  by  the
         six-character error code or "prefix" followed by the text  body
         of the error message itself (followed by a "]" to terminate the
         message if it was lead off with a  "[").   All  error  messages
         appear  in  upper  and lower case for neatness.  (The prefix is
         always uuper case only, as are all file specs  that  are  typed
         out.)

     2.  /MESSAGE:(PREFIX,FIRST,CONTIN)

         The standard (error) message output format is adhered to.   The
         "/MESSAGE"  setting  in  the  user's  watch  word  is  used  to
         determine which fields are actually to be printed on the user's
         TTY.   If  all  settings  are  blank  then PREFIX and FIRST are
         assumed.  (Note that CREF does not have a /MESSAGE switch -  it
         can only read the watch word to see what the user job has set.)
CRF53.DOC                                                         Page 9


     3.  New Messages

         CREF 53(53) has the following new messages for your amusement:

         a.  %CRFPUE Please Use "=" Rather Than "_"

             The underscore (or left arrow on some TTY's  -  octal  code
             137)  is  reserved  for  use by network protocal to specify
             nodes.  The "=" character should be used instead.

         b.  %CRFSIH "/H" or "/R" Switch Illegal In SWITCH.INI

             The two switches "/R" and "/H" are illegal  when  specified
             in SWITCH.INI defaulting.  The "/H" would never let you get
             any work done - the philosophy of the HELP switch  is  that
             when  it  is  encountered the help message is output to the
             user's TTY and the current command is  aborted.   The  "/R"
             switch  has no complement and so can not be turned off once
             you have set it (it's cleared at the start of every command
             but  if it's also set every command you're stuck) so it has
             been made illegal.

         c.  %CRFSII Syntax Error In SWITCH.INI Defaults

             CREF is unable to read SWITCH.INI due to some construct  in
             SWITCH.INI  which  is  illegal  (for example trying to give
             file specs).  SWITCH.INI will be ignored.

         d.  %CRFSIO I/O Error While Reading SWITCH.INI

             In process of reading SWITCH.INI CREF got an I/O  error  of
             some type.  SWITCH.INI will be ignored, defaulting will not
             occur.

         e.  ?CRFUKS Unknown Switch

             The user (or SWITCH.INI) specified an illegal  switch.   If
             the  illegal  switch  appeared  in SWITCH.INI then the fact
             will be noted in the message.

         f.  ?CRFCDN Can't Get Command File Device

             The device specified in  the  command  stream  as  the  new
             indirect command file device cannot be OPENed by CREF.

         g.  ?CRFCLC Can't LOOKUP Command File

             The indirect command file specified  in  the  input  stream
             cannot be found for reading by CREF.
CRF53.DOC                                                        Page 10


         h.  ?CRFIBP Input Buffer Size Phase Error

             This error can only happen on multiple input files.   Since
             the   input  buffers  are  allocated  before  the  file  is
             processed, files later in the command string must  not  use
             more  buffer  space  than  the first input file (or buffers
             would  overwrite  the  various  symbol   tables   CREF   is
             building).  Should this happen (for example reading first a
             file on disk - with 200 (octal) word buffers - then a  file
             on  a magtape written with 2K word buffers) then this error
             message will be issued and  the  current  command  will  be
             aborted.


2.5  SWITCH.INI Switch Defaulting

CREF  53(53)  now  supports  basic  switch  defaulting  via   the   file
DSK:SWITCH.INI[,].   The user may put in any switches other than "/H" or
"/R" but should be cautioned that  tape-positioning  commands  "/A"  and
"/B"  will  not  be  effected  more  than  once per file spec (i.e., the
sequence "/A"  or  "/A/A/A/A"  appearing  in  SWITCH.IN  would  have  an
identical  effect - the "/A" function would be applied once to each file
spec the user typed.  The user may not specify  file  specifications  in
SWITCH.INI.

SWITCH.INI is read when CREF is started and  a  "map"  of  the  switches
specified  is made and remembered, then applied as needed for successive
user commands (either CCL or regular typed-in commands).

The switch "/C" Cancels SWITCH.INI defaulting;  the switch "/D" restores
SWITCH.INI   defaulting  (note  that  to  completely  cancel  SWITCH.INI
defaulting the "/C" switch should be issued on the output file specs).



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known bugs in CREF 53(53) as of 6-Dec-76.

The command scanner in CREF still isn't very smart, and can bomb you out
rather inelegantly.

The "/R" switch applied to multiple FORTRAN input listings  may  or  may
not  do  what the user intended.  The meaning of the switch in this case
is somewhat ambiguous - does the user want each seperate  subroutine  to
be   restarted  at  the  specified  line  or  does  the  user  want  the
line-printer output  to  be  restarted  at  the  physical  printed  line
specified?

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The source file for CREF is standalone (it does not  need  any  external
parameter files) so simply compile it with MACRO-10.

CREF needs the standard HELP processor HELPER.REL when being loaded.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

EDIT   SPR               WHAT AND WHY

30     none      General cosmetic edits to make the listing prettier and
                 easier to read.

31     none      Move the data introduced into the low segment into  the
                 high  segment so as to allow CREF to be resident on the
                 swapping space and much easier  on  the  monitor.   The
                 data  (introduced  by  the  TOPS20 compatibility edits)
                 will be BLT'd down at program start time.

32     none      Add code to recognize and handle  SFD's  in  file  path
                 specifications.

33     none      Add code to allow user to type in file specs to be used
                 as indirect command file.

34     none      Convert all messages from SIXBIT to ASCII and put  them
                 in mixed upper/lower case for neat appearance.

35     none      Begin change over to using "=" rather  than  the  older
                 "_"   character   to  delimit  input  and  output  file
                 specifications.  The  "_"  character  is  reserved  for
                 network usage (specifying nodes).

36     none      Generally clean up the low level  command  input  code.
                 Treat the old altmode characters "~" and "}" as regular
                 ASCII characters.

37     none      Teach cref about comments (";") and continuation  lines
                 ("-").    Use   SCAN's   conventions   regarding   such
                 constructs as "BLAH  -  ;comment  comment"  (this  case
                 would be considered a continuation line).

40     none      Teach CREF about the /MESSAGE bits in the  job's  watch
                 word.   Output  the various messages in the appropriate
                 format.

41     none      Make non-break control characters before <LF> be syntax
                 error  (formerly would treat as pseudo-break characters
                 and internally delimit the command).

42     none      Make illegal switch processing  more  elegant,  put  in
                 "?CRFUKS Unknown Switch" message.

43     none      Do a RESCAN on CCL entry so can  allow  users  to  type
                 monitor  command  of  form  ".CREF/P"  to make the "/P"
                 switch  sticky  on  all  CCL  processing.   Also  allow
                 commands of form ".CREF TTY:=BLAH/S/O/P" etc.

44     none      Support DSK:SWITCH.INI[,] for defaulting switches.

45     none      Bug in "/R" processing, conflicts with "/R" in CCL file
                 and  "/R"  in  ".CREF/R"  commands,  with ".CREF A=B/R"
                 commands.

46     none      Some code got moved around, if  indirect  command  file
                 didn't  exist  could  get into the RUN processor rather
                 than the error message processor.

47     none      Look for  SWITCH.INI  on  logged  in  PPN  rather  than
                 default  path.   This  is  the  way SCAN does it and we
                 should try to be compatible.

50     none      When reading multiple input files delete each one as we
                 go  rather  than  just  the  last one.  (Be sure not to
                 delete any of them if the "/P" switch was given!)

51     none      Make   the   command   scanner    even    more    picky
                 (unconditionally  cause error message if syntax error -
                 don't try to find files  based  on  the  partial  specs
                 built  up  before  the  error)  yet more flexible as to
                 constructs of the form ".FOO MUMBLE blah:" a  la  SCAN.
                 Make  the  monitor-level  command  "CREF/H"  EXIT after
                 having typed the help text.

52     10-18277  Must wait to  setup  input  buffers  until  have  setup
                 output  buffers  so  as  not  to  reset .JBFF below the
                 output buffers (and thereby  timeshare  them  with  the
                 symbol  chain  being  built in "free core").  Also, for
                 multiple

53     none      Edit 50 went  too  far:   only  delete  input  file  if
                 extension  is  .LST  or  .CRF.   input  files make sure
                 successive files do not use more buffer space than  the
                 first  file  used  - or the input buffers will run into
                 the already-extant (and allocated!)  "free  core"  area
                 (issue the ?CRFIBP error message in this case).

6.0  SUGGESTIONS

It would be nice if CREF were smarter in how it handled command errors -
say  "Duplicate device illegal" instead of the general catch-all "Syntax
error".  Especially, CREF should not  go  trapsing  around  looking  for
things  to  do  if the user only typed <CR><LF>, it should just give out
another "*" and let it go at that.

Put in SCAN and WILD for true  compatibility  with  other  DEC  software
(like  DIRECT),  also  give  ability  to  use  wildcards  (e.g.,  ".CREF
*/SINCE:YESTERDAY/O" etc.).

CREF.DOC -- Changes from V47 to V51(20)
September 1974



1.0  SUMMARY

The reasons for this release are:

     A)  To provide support for FORTRAN-10 version 2.

     B)  To correct outstanding bugs in CREF version 47.

     C)  Define error mnemonic per DECsystem-10 error message standard.

CREF version 51 is CREF version 47 with edits 17 and 20.   This  version
fully replaces all earlier versions of CREF and is upward compatible.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

All messages typed by CREF are preceded by appropriate  error  mnemonics
per the DECsystem-10 error message standard.

The command scanner will exit on an EOF from the input stream.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

CREF V51 has no known bugs or deficiencies.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

CREF now includes routines to read line numbers from the input file  for
use in generating cross reference information.

Unsupported feature test switches have been added for FAIL  format  CREF
files and for the TENEX file system.

A new SORT routine has been added to speed up sorting the CREF listing.

CREF now supports a terminating character to allow the user to terminate
CREF  information without inserting either line numbers or tabs into the
output listing (thus making it possible to have multiple blocks of  CREF
information of a line).

An additional terminating character for program break has been defined.

The following are the edits made:

EDIT #

17 HPW - Implement new features for FORTRAN-10 version 2.  Define  error
         mnemonics.

20 ASM - Add features for the TENEX file system.

CREF.DOC -- V47(16)
November 1972



1.0  SUMMARY

CREF's command language features have been cleaned up:

CREF publishes its name "CREF:  " and the names of the input files  when
running in CCL mode, and "NAME!" is accepted to run another program.

DSK:  is the default output device when an explicit output file name  is
present.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

CREF publishes its name on the user terminal  when  running  in  Command
Language mode.

When an explicit output filename is present, DSK:  is the default output
device.   If  no explicit output file name is present, LPT:  remains the
default output device.

A lookup failure on an input file (such as if the file does  not  exist)
no  longer  causes CREF to abort operation.  CREF will continue scanning
input files and creating  the  cross  reference  listing(s),  minus  the
missing input file.  The "?CANNOT FIND FILE ...  " message will be typed
for each occurance of a missing file.  (if the missing file is the first
input  file  not in CCL mode, that is, typed in by hand, CREF will still
abort, allowing the user to retype the command.) This change allows  CCL
files to run to completion even if one small part fails, and allows CREF
to delete the command file at the end, thus precluding the same  missing
input  file  from  causing  messages  and  terminated  operation  on any
following CREF commands.  If any file  is  missing,  CREF  sets  the  /P
switch so no input file will be deleted.

There is a "HELP" text.  Typing "/H" will cause the file SYS:CREF.HLP to
be typed on the users terminal.

     "NAME!  will run the program SYS:NAME".

The "?COMMAND ERROR" message now reads

     "?COMMAND ERROR--TYPE /H FOR HELP".



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

When more than one input file is combined into a  single  cref  listing,
CREF  deletes  only  the last input file instead of all the input files.
Proper operation would store the filenames of all the  input  files  and
CRF47.DOC                                                        Page 17


delete  them only after all the input files are read and the output file
is closed with no errors.

CREF still won't accept a command file with @filename.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

None.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

A KI10 core allocation bug is fixed.  At the  beginning  of  each  input
file,  the switch allowing only the new CREF special codes is cleared so
that older programs and FORTAN listings may be combined with  the  newer
listings  produced  by  MACRO.  An old monitor bug has been fixed.  This
bug caused an output file to be deleted if an input  file  of  the  same
name  was  deleted.  CREF's defensive code to avoid deleting input files
in this case has been removed.  Since the monitor bug has been fixed for
two years, hopefully this will cause no problems.

A general cleanup of the cref listing was done.  The standard TECO macro
to  format  the listing and allign the comments was used.  FILCOM's /B/C
switches make comparing the old and new versions reasonable.

All of CREF's internal "RPG" symbols were edited to change them to "CCL"
symbols to make them more mnemonic.
