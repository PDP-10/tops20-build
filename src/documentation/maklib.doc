MAKLIB.DOC -- Changes from V2A(67) to V2B(107)
February 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 2B is a maintenance release of MAKLIB and contains  bug  fixes
and minor enhancements.

MAKLIB should be compiled  with  MACRO  V53A  or  later.   The  latest
distributed  copies of MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV, SCNMAC.UNV, HELPER.REL,
SCAN.REL, and WILD.REL should be used.  In addition, LINK 4A(1220)  or
a later version should be used.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

      1.0  No existing commands or actions have been changed.

      2.0  If one of the files to be appended is missing, MAKLIB  will
          continue  processing  after  displaying  the  ?MKLNPC  error
          message.  This message has been changed from a warning to  a
          fatal error.

      3.0  The following error messages have been changed to make them
          more readable and meaningful.

          OLD:  ?MKLTMN Too many module names

          NEW:  ?MKLTMN Too many module names ..  stopped at [MODULE]

          OLD:  ?MKLBDA Bad .DATE argument 

          NEW:  ?MKLBDA Bad .DATE argument for edit:  [EDIT]

          OLD:  %MKLNPC No program code was found for module

          NEW:  ?MKLNPC No  program  code  was  found  for  module  in
          edit      [EDIT] 

          OLD:  %MKLTFR all TRANSACTION files rejected by condition.

          NEW:  ?MKLTFR all TRANSACTION files rejected by condition.




3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The following is for informational purposes only.   The  feature  test
switch  FTBPT  has  been  added.  All of the code to facilitate binary
patching is under this  conditional,  which  is  distributed  as  "ON"
(non-zero)  in  the  field-image  version.  Since the code for the BPT
comprises about 80% of MAKLIB, turning this switch off if the  BPT  is
not needed can save some memory space.

Manual loading of SCAN, WILD and HELPER is no longer necessary as  the
.REQUEST  and  .REQUIRE  pseudo-ops  have  been  added  to  facilitate
automatic requests for these routines.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

The following is for informational purposes only.  Much  addition  and
re-organization  of the program was done to enable the addition of the
BPT.  the register allocation and much of the I/O has been re-written.
In  addition,  a  small  loader  and a large MACRO assembler have been
added to allow binary patching.  Also, a  module  has  been  added  to
allow  MAKLIB  to  do  internal  tests of its own routines.  This is a
debugging feature, and is not present in the field-image version.




EDIT        SPR        COMMENT


70        22997        Allow standard SCAN/WILD switches (i.e.  SINCE,
                       BEFORE, ETC.) TO WORK.


71        27130        Fix indexing of block that is Exactly 200
                       (octal) words long.


72        24665        Have switch processing continue if one file not
                       found.


73        12886        Get right file name in NIO error message.


74        (NONE)       Fix "ILL MEM REF" caused by looking at an
                       invalid polish pointer.


75        (NONE)       Give an error message if the user tries to
                       remove an edit that has no code associated with
                       it.

76        (NONE)       Give correct device in LOOKUP error message in
                       SWTDIS.


77        (NONE)       Increase the number of modules that can be
                       specified on one command line from 20 to 100.

                       .." how far modules are being accepted by
                       clarifying the message "Too many module..
                       stopped at [module].


101       (NONE)       Add edit number to the error message ?MKLBDA.


102       (NONE)       Give Error Return If INSERT or ALTER pseudo-op

                       and list.


105       30405        Improve effective address calculation.  EVAADR
                       should skip EVALEX pass if "(" followed by
                       blank and accept the valid return value in AC
                       "A" by checking c.lhnz.


106       (NONE)       Recognize partially defined symbol if it is
                       dependant on another symbol.


107       30538        If no transaction file exists Maklib returns
                       MKLTFR as a fatal error instead of a warning
                       message.

MKL2A.DOC -- Changes from V2(14) to V2A(63)
July 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 2A is a maintenance release of MAKLIB and contains bug fixes
and minor enhancements.

MAKLIB should be compiled with MACRO V53A or later.  The latest
distributed copies of MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV, SCNMAC.UNV, HELPER.REL,
SCAN.REL, and WILD.REL should be used.  In addition, to correctly load
programs containing MAKLIB binary fixes, a version of LINK with edit
454 must be used.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following restriction should be noted when creating FIX files for
use with the FIX command switch:  Unconditional branch instructions
(JRST, JUMPA) should not be used as the reference line (code to match)
of a .INSERT pseudo-op with KEYWORD:AFTER.  Attempts to do this will
result in patches which are unreachable.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Installation instructions follow in section 4 of MKL2.DOC which is
appended.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.

MAKLIB.DOC -- Changes from V1(6) to V2(14)
JANUARY 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

The main reason for the release of MAKLIB V.2 is the addition of the
Binary Patching Tool.  (BPT) The BPT was included to allow some level
of support for products distributed in relocatable binary format
rather than source level.

MAKLIB should be compiled with MACRO V50 or later.  The latest
distributed copies of MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV, SCNMAC.UNV, HELPER.REL
and WILD.REL should be used.  (See MAKLIB.CTL).  The version of SCAN
that MAKLIB uses is SCN7A, although any SCAN V7 is usable as long as
the appropriate changes are made to the MAKLIB source.  In addition to
this, to correctly load programs containing MAKLIB binary fixes, a
version of LINK with edit 454 must be used.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

No existing commands or actions were changed.  For a description of
the use of the BPT, refer to MAKLIB.HLP or MAKLIB.MAN.  A more full
implementation of system-standard error messages is also part of this
release.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The main use of the BPT will be for installation of DEC supplied
patches to products for which the sources are not available.  The BPT
will work with REL files produced by MACRO V50 and BLISS10.  The BPT
may not work with any code produced by a compiler using polish fixups
or internal fixups.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The feature test switch FTBPT has been added.  All of the code to
facilitate binary patching is under this conditional, which is
distributed as "on" (non-zero) in the field-image version.  Since the
code for the BPT comprises about 80% of MAKLIB, turning this switch
off if the BPT is not needed can save some memory space.

Manual loading of SCAN, WILD and HELPER is no longer necessary as the
.REQUEST and .REQUIRE pseudo-ops have been added to facilitate
automatic requests for these routines.

MAKLIB.DOC -- V1(6)
July 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

MAKLIB is intended as an eventual replacement for FUDGE2.  

This version has been tested under 5.07 and 6.01 as well as 6.02
monitors.  It uses SCAN Version 7 and WILD Version 7.

MAKLIB.HLP describes the various commands to MAKLIB and their
functions.  See FUDGE2 documentation in the Software Notebooks for a
description of indexing.  MAKLIB is described in the SYSTEM COMMANDS
section of the Software Notebooks.  See the SCAN documentation in the
Software Notebooks for information about command scanning.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Differences from FUDGE2-2D

MAKLIB does not delete local symbols when indexing the library.

Command strings are ended by carriage return line feed.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Must be loaded with SCAN and WILD.  See MAKLIB.CTL for details on
installation.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

MAKLIB has been updated to recognize LINK block types 1000 to 1777 and
to handle ASCII text blocks.

Edit #

01     All switches except INDEX and INSERT are recognizable as one
       letter abbreviations.

02     Issue correct error message for protection violation.

03     Issue error messages for switches on output and for more than
       one switch given with a stand-alone switch(INDEX,NOLOCAL).

04     Do not replace specified extension with .LST on LIST and
       POINTS, but do fill it in as default.

05     Error messages for modules out of order made more specific.

06     Version number fixed.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
