1.0  SUMMARY

FE is a utility for file transfers between the TOPS-20 file system and
the  FILES-11  file  system.   It handles protocol for the "FE" device
such that FE:  can be addressed as a FILES-11 device, usually  through
-11 PIP.

                           *** CAUTION ***

               The "FE" device is intended for use only
               in  software  development  and  updating
               procedures by knowledgeable people.  Use
               without   proper   caution  may  produce
               unpredictable results.

FE runs under TOPS-20 Release 6.

FE depends on the existance of the RSX-20F task T20ACP,  which  should
reside on the -11 file system as "T20ACP.TSK".

Use of FE and file conversion procedures are described in the Guide To
Using the "FE" Device, USEFE.MEM.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

FE will work properly with  any  of  TOPS20"s  FE  devices  (FE0-FEn).
However, RSX20F will only correspond using FE0.  If FE0 is unavailable
the FE program cannot communicate with RSX20F.  Only one  copy  of  FE
may be run at a time.
