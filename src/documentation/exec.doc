There will be two new features in the TOPS-20 release 7.0 EXEC. The first
is to support DQS and LAT remote printing, and the second adds subcommands
to the DELETE command.


                     REMOTE PRINTING SUPPORT


  (1) Three new commands have been added to the family of SET commands. They
have the following form(s).

 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER (NAME) alias (IS) VMS queue name	(ON) node
						LAT Port name	     LAT Server
						LAT Service name  
						existing alias	     -------

  This creates an "alias" remote printer name which can then be used
as input to the new /REMOTE-PRINTER: switch for the PRINT command.



 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING CHARACTERISTIC (NAME) name (IS) bit number 
						      number,number,....
						      existing name
						      name,name,name...
						      name,number,name....

 This creates a CHARACTERISTIC name which can be used as input to
the new /CHARACTERISTIC: switch for the PRINT command. CHARACTERISTICS
are names for print formats and types (pitch, bold print, etc.) which
would be explained by the documentation for the particular type of printer, 
as would the appropriate bit-settings to use for each.

 Combinations of bit numbers can be used to create one CHARACTERISTIC,
as can combinations of already-defined names, or combinations of names and
bit numbers - note that the names must already have been defined.




 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING SYSTEM-DEFINITIONS

 	This does a TAKE of a file called SYSTEM:REMOTE-PRINTING.CMD.
The file should have the basic SET REMOTE-PRINTING definitions for all
queues, services, characteristics available to the users on the system.
If the users in turn find they wish to create their own aliases for
already-defined printers or characteristics, they may; but in any case,
these definitions will always be job-wide. This way, if a user or site
does not use the feature, there will be no use of EXEC freespace for it.
If, on the other hand, a site wishes all users to have the definitions
set up, the SET REMOTE-PRINTING SYSTEM-DEFINITIONS command could be
put into the SYSTEM: .CMD files.
  
EXAMPLES:

a) Set up an alias for a XEROX laser printer

 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER (NAME) XEROX_LASER_PRINTER (IS) A_VMS$QUE (ON) FOO

b) Make a handier name for it because  I use it all the time
 
 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER (NAME) XEROX (IS) XEROX_LASER_PRINTER

c) Delete my handy name

 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING PRINTER (NAME) XEROX


d) Make an alias for regular 8&1/2 by 11 format

 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING CHARACTERISTIC (NAME) PORTRAIT (IS) 52

e) Make an alias for overhead projector slide format

 @SET REMOTE-PRINTING CHARACTERISTIC (NAME) SLIDE (IS) PORTRAIT,65,100




(2) Two new switches have been added to the PRINT command - /REMOTE-PRINTER:
and /CHARACTERISTIC: . Input to these can be remote printer "alias" names
and characteristic names which have been previously created by the SET
commands. 

In addition, names which are not in the tables can be used. For printers,
the user simply supplies the VMS queue, or LAT Port/Service Name to the
/REMOTE-PRINTER: switch, and then supplies the node or Server name using the
/DESTINATION-NODE: switch. Since, however, the "destination-node" field
is used to inform GALAXY of the remote printer node name, it will
be an error to use an "alias" name from the table AND supply a
/DESTINATION-NODE:.

For CHARACTERISTICS not in the table, the user can supply a bit number
or a list of bit numbers in parentheses and separated by commas, to the
/CHARACTERISTIC: switch.



(3) INFORMATION (ABOUT) REMOTE-PRINTING

This command will give the user a list of remote printer "alias" names
and characteristic names which are set up for the job. For remote
printer "aliases" , the list will show the "alias" name, the queue/port/service
name, and the node/server name.  For characteristics, the name only will
be listed.




			DELETE SUBCOMMANDS

Four new subcommands will be useable with the DELETE command, and will work
the same way as they do with the DIRECTORY command.

The four are: BEFORE, SINCE, LARGER, SMALLER. BEFORE/SINCE will accept
a date and time, LARGER/SMALLER will accept a file size in decimal pages.

			CLUSTER ENHANCEMENTS
				TO
		        SYSTAT, ^ESEND/SEND


A cluster-wide, or cluster node SYSTAT can now be obtained. The "NODE"
subcommand to the SYSTAT command will accept a CI node name (available
nodes listed by question-mark help) or "*" for all nodes in the cluster.

  @SYSTAT NODE [CI node name, or * for all]



SEND and ^ESEND can now be used to send a TTY message to other nodes in 
the cluster (question-mark help will list available CI node names) or
by using "*", to all nodes in the cluster. NOTE: "*" send-to-all requires
priviliges.

  @(^E)SEND /NODE:[CI node name, or * for all- if priv'ed]




	

			NEW ^ESET COMMANDS

Three ^ESET [NO] commands have been added.

   $^ESET [NO] OFFLINE STRUCTURES will disable/enable  the offline structures
feature. When enabling, a timeout value of 00:01 to 15:00 will be accepted,
or <CR> will default the value to 5 seconds.


   $^ESET [NO] CLUSTER SENDALLS will disable/enable the cluster sendall feature
on the local system. This feature is "on" by default, so the local system
will receive cluster TTMSG's unless it is disabled.


   $^ESET [NO] CLUSTER SENDALLS will disable/enable the local node from
answering cluster INFO% requests. This feature is "on" by default, so
cluster INFO% requests will be answered by the local system unless it is
disabled.
