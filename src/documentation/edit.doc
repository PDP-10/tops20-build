EDIT.DOC -- Changes from V4(51) to V5(51)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

EDIT is a line-oriented editor which is used to create and  edit  text
files.   It  resembles  the TOPS-10 editor SOS in function and command
structure.

EDIT version 5(51) runs on TOPS-20 Release 5.

EDIT does not depend on any other software during its execution.

EDIT is documented in the DECSYSTEM-20 Edit User's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

New command EK exists, which removes line sequence  numbers  and  also
page marks (form feeds).  This is very similar to EU, but is even more
complete.

Line sequence files now have byte sizes of 36 bits.  This was done  to
make the EXEC APPEND command work correctly.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run EDIT
