WILD.DOC -- Changes from V7A(325) TO V7D(345)
January, 1982



1.0  SUMMARY

This is a maintenance release of WILD necessary to correct  errors  in
DIRECT, BACKUP, and other utility programs.  Corrections were selected
based upon the dual requirements of having high value  and  low  risk.
The version number of WILD is being changed to make it consistent with
SCAN.  This fixes all SPRs received through December, 1981.

WILD version 7D runs on all supported monitors.  It has been tested on
TOPS-10 V7.01 and TOPS-20 V4.  There are no known deficiencies.


1.1  Function of WILD

WILD is designed to be used as a subroutine called  from  any  program
which  needs to perform wild-card lookups on any device.  It is needed
since the logic for selecting and reading directories has become quite
involved.   Among  the  special  cases  handled  correctly by WILD are
sub-file   directories,   NEW:,   HLP:,    SYSA:,    and    controller
controller-class and file structure abbreviations.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install in any program, relink that program using the new WILD.REL

All programs which are to use WILD version 7D  should  be  checked  to
insure  that  they  request  WILD, and not a specific version of WILD,
such as WLD7A.

Note that although there are several programs which use WILD, we  will
not  necessarily  rebuild  all  of them when WILD is released.  If the
customer experiences a problem with a program which is  fixed  by  the
new version of WILD, he may rebuild the product at his discretion.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

Support PATH names.

WILD.DOC -- Changes from V7 to V7A(325)
July, 1975



1.0 SUMMARY

1.1    This release supports the SCAN guide words of 'AND', 'OR',  and
       'NOT'.   'OR'  take the replacement of "+" in previous versions
       for DIRECT and QUEUE.  "+" still works for  this  version,  but
       will   be  changed  in  the  next  version  to  mean  only  its
       traditional meaning of file concatenation.  This version  fixes
       all SPRs prior to JAN-1975.

1.2    WILD version 7A runs on all monitors.  It has  been  tested  on
       6.02.   There  are  no known deficiencies.  WILD fully supports
       the DATE-75 project.

1.3    WILD version 7A is documented in  the  specification  WILD.RNO.
       Also,  it  is  documented  implicitly  in the software notebook
       description of DIRECT, and briefly in chapter one of the system
       command  manual.   Supporting documentation can be found in the
       .DOC files for SCAN version 7 and DIRECT version 3.

1.4    Function of WILD
       WILD is designed to be used as a  subroutine  called  from  any
       program which needs to perform wild-card lookups on any device.
       It  is  needed  since  the  logic  for  selecting  and  reading
       directories  has  become  quite  involved  under  the  5-series
       monitor.  Among the special cases handled correctly by WILD and
       few  other  user-mode  programs are sub-file directories, NEW:,
       HLP:, SYSA:, and controller controller-class and file structure
       abbreviations.  Most Digital supplied utilities will eventually
       be converted to use WILD if they perform wild-card operations.



2.0    CHANGES

321    add new entry point for .instr which causes frcppn to be set.

322    make .inist and .nxstr entry points.

323    Don't discard SFD's when ersatz device and file is wild.

324    (SPR-17317) Use 'SYS' as 'NEW,SYS' if /NEW enabled  and  ersatz
       device SYS is requested.

325    (SPR 10-17642) allow 'NOT' guide word to work with PPNs.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The dummy low-segment file  WILDDM  has  been  removed  since  LINK-10
version  2 (released on the July, 1974 distribution tape) has a switch
/ONLY:LOW which can achieve the same effect and  ensures  the  correct
low  segment  is  included.  Thus, all commands which reference WILDDM
should be changed to WILD/ONLY:LOW.

Note that although there are several programs which use WILD and SCAN,
we  will  not  necessarily  rebuild all of them when WILD is released.
Typically, the various utilities such as DIRECT  and  QUEUE  and  DUMP
will  be rebuilt, but major products such as LINK and FORTRAN will not
be rebuilt until their  next  release.   If  the  customer  wishes  to
rebuild,  he  may,  but  usually  the  changes to WILD and SCAN do not
warrent the cost of rebuilding and testing.

5.0  SUGGESTIONS

Read the directories via super USETI if  possible  for  better  speed.
This  would  also  allow  a  pack  to  be  read  when not mounted as a
structure.

Support a switch to control SFD scanning, going  to  LIB:   and  SYS:.
This would override the job's default.

Make the routine  which  outputs  "IN  USE  BY  JOB  n"  be  generally
available.

Extend the error message routines to include all the components  of  a
concatenated specification.

Include /BEFORE, etc., in the error message "NO SUCH  FILE  AS"  since
the file may exist, but it is just excluded by the constraints.

Expand the search logic to allow concatenation  of  directories  which
are different (SPR 10-9943).

(SPR 10-10209) Add switches to control the  start  and  end  of  files
which  match  a  wild-card.   Thus,  the  user  could  "restart"  on a
specified file.  Also, add switches which specify to skip n files  and
then do m files.

(SPR 10-102019) Add a switch to do the files in reverse  order.   This
would catch recent files before older ones.

(SPR 10-13457) Allow the caller to specify a channel which can be kept
OPEN in order to speed up the processing.

                        EXTRACTS FROM WLD7.DOC




300    Support the file specification separator guide words of  'AND',
       'OR',  and 'NOT' as passed from SCAN version 7.  Of these, 'OR'
       has lower precedence, and 'NOT' is interpretted  as  though  it
       were  "AND  NOT".   A  file  is  selected  only if it meets the
       constraints of one of the sets separated by 'OR'.  Within  such
       a  set,  all  matches  must  be  met including switches such as
       /BEFORE and /LENGTH.  'NOT' is interpretted essentially  as  an
       exclusion, i.e., as though the user said "ALL x EXCEPT y".

301    Default to /OKPROTECTION if there are  any  wild  cards.   This
       will tend to hide protected files from the user in order to not
       confuse him.

302    If the input side has more wild cards  than  the  output  side,
       give  the  message  ?WLDTWC  TOO  MANY  WILD-CARDS ON INPUT FOR
       OUTPUT.  This means that the user must specify the same  number
       of wild-cards on input and output.

303    Whenever the user gives a device name which implies  more  than
       one structure, ignore any structures which are single access by
       other jobs than the user's.

304    Issue a new warning message if all files which were  found  (or
       all  directories)  had  protection  failures.   The  message is
       %WLDAFP ALL FILES PROTECTED file-spec.

305    Issue a new warning message if all files which were found  were
       rejected  either  by  such switches as /SINCE or by the logical
       conditions introduced by edit 300.  The message is %WLDAFR  ALL
       FILES REJECTED BY CONDITIONS file-spec.

306    (SPR 10-13,944)  Correct  typo  in  one  of  the  LOOKUP  error
       messages.

307    (QAR 2760) Add error message %WLDSDP SOME DIRECTORIES PROTECTED
       which  indicates that the file was not found in any directories
       looked at, but some of the directories which matched  the  spec
       where protected against the user.

310    (QAR 2836) Correct a bug introduced in edit 304.

311    Add message %WLDSFP SOME FILES PROTECTED which will  be  issued
       if  some  files  match and also some files or directories which
       might have matched could not be accessed.  This message can  be
       suppressed with the switch /OKNONE, which suppresses all of the
       summary warning messages.

                        EXTRACTS FROM WLD6.DOC




143    Remove  a   bug   which   caused   [p,pn,*,*,*]   and   similar
       constructions  to not work as intended.  This construction will
       now correctly find all files.

144    Correct a bug in the handling of wild-cards on DECtapes.

145    As a performance improvement, especially for  KJOB  calling  of
       QUEUE,  delete  directory  access  tables only if the directory
       does not belong to the user.

146    Add  the  capability  for  the  caller  to  obtain  a  list  of
       structures   which   match   the  user  specified  device.   In
       particular, "SYS" will return the sys-search list;  "ALL"  will
       return  the  all-search list;  "DPA" will return all structures
       on RP10 number 0;  etc.  There are two new entry points, .INSTR
       and  .NXSTR.   The  first  initializes  the proceedure with the
       user's device and the /PHYSICAL switch if specified;  and  skip
       returns with a code to indicate whether multiple structures may
       be involved.  The second takes no argument and returns the name
       of  the  next  structure,  or  0 when done.  These routines are
       self-initializing, but can not  be  used  while  .LKWLD  is  in
       progress.

147    Convert to use C.MAC and SCNMAC.MAC as universal files.

150    Support the user specified /MESSAGE level  from  .GTWCH.   This
       allows  the  user  to  obtain  either  the error prefix, or the
       message, or both.

151    Move the routine .PTWRD to .SCAN.

152    Support /MESSAGE switch from SCAN.

153    (SPR 10-12368) Handle UFD names when they occur as a file  (not
       as SIXBIT).

154    Fix /STR with non-wild names to use the correct  directory  (if
       device forces it) and to issue the correct messages if the file
       or directory is missing.

155    If /OKNONE is given, then no error will be listed if  the  file
       is  missing.   This  extends  the  influence  of  the switch to
       non-wild environments as well as wild ones.

156    (SPR 10-12368) Support  the  switches  /BEFORE  and  /SINCE  on
       DEC-tapes.

157    Add an optional argument to .LKWLD to specify the address of  a
       routine  to  call  whenever  end of directory is reached.  This
       will allow DIRECT to issue its summaries more rapidly.
WILD.DOC -- Changes from V5 to V6                              Page 10


160    Add an option bit to cause SFD scanning down to  occur  at  the
       end  of  the  owning  directory instead of in the middle.  This
       necessitates a second pass for any directory containing an SFD,
       but  allows  DIRECT  to  give  a  cleaner listing when multiple
       levels are specified.

161    Support the switches  /ABEFORE,  /ASINCE,  /LENGTH,  /ESTIMATE,
       /ERSUPERSEDE, and /VERSION.

162    (QAR 1882) More of edit 153.

163    More of edit 161.  Also, clean up the handling of  the  special
       error code inserts.

164    More of edit 161.

165    Correct NUL:  handling in 135.

                        EXTRACTS FROM WLD5.DOC




123    Add a new error message "?  NO FILE NAME SPECIFIED".

124    Add routine .SCWLD  to  handle  secondary  wild-cards  such  as
       output files.

125    Simplify checks for end of directory list.

126    At location WILDK, replace the HALT with a JRST to recover from
       read errors in the directory.

127    Add routines E.LKEN and .TFILB as general  purpose  SCAN  style
       typeout blocks.

130    Create a dummy module, WILDDM, which defines a low segment  the
       same size as WILDs.  This will be updated each release.

131    In .SCWLD, if the input and  output  files  are  for  the  same
       owner, set the default protection to be xyy where x is from the
       system standard file protection and yy is from the input file.

132    Support the DATE75 project when checking the /BEFORE and /SINCE
       switches.

133    Support   the   /OKPROTECTION   and   /ERPROTECTION   switches.
       /OKPROTECTION suppresses protection check error messages.  This
       is the default if the UFD is wild.

134    Correct error in edit 127.

135    Handle device NUL: correctly.   NUL:  is  considered  to  be  a
       non-directory device for callers of WILD.

136    (SPR 10-10819) Fix a bug in the  DECtape  directory  logic  for
       wild-carding which omitted the first file of the directory.

137    Type the correct directory when the UFD has a protection  error
       and the user was trying to specify the directory itself.

140    Change all error messages  to  have  a  unique  prefix  of  six
       letters starting with WLD.  The message prefixes are:
          DEM     %directory is empty
          DFO     ?open failure for xxx in use by job nnn
          IOE     %error while reading file
          IWC     ?insufficient wild-cards in input for output
          LKE      lookup/enter failure (or mnemonic message)
          LKP     %lookup failure (or mnemonic message)
          NDO     ?null name in output wild-card
          NFS     ?no file name specified
          NNO     ?null directory in output wild-card
          NSD     %no such directory
WILD.DOC -- Changes from V4 to V5                              Page 12


          NSF     %no such files as
          NXD     %non-existent ufd

          SCO     ?open failure on xxx in use by job nnn
          SLE     %search list empty for device
       Each error message has a  local  symbol  defined  of  the  form
       E$$xxx where xxx is the unique error suffix.

141    (SPR 10-11421) Verify that /STRS and /PHYSICAL are the same  on
       all files of a concatenated specification.

142    Correctly store for the caller  the  pointer  to  the  matching
       input file spec.

111  FOR MAG-TAPES, SET OPEN BLOCK DEPENDING  UPON  THE  /DENSITY  AND
     /PARITY SWITCHES.

112  CHANGE /BEFORE  AND  /SINCE  LOGIC  TO  CONSIDER  -1  AS  DEFAULT
     BEHAVIOUR.

113  IF THE USER'S PROJECT NUMBER IS GREATER THAN 7,  AND  THE  TARGET
     DIRECTORY PROJECT IS LESS THAN 10, THEN IF THE USER TYPED "*" FOR
     PROJECT AND NOT "*" FOR PROGRAMMER NUMBER REJECT THE MATCH.  THIS
     SUPPORTS  THE  NOTION  THAT FOR PROJECTS BELOW 10, THE PROGRAMMER
     NUMBER IS INDEPENDENT OF THOSE ABOVE  10.   IN  PARTICULAR,  WITH
     LIBRARIES,  ETC.,  BEING  DEVELOPED  FOR PROJECTS BELOW 10, USERS
     LOOKING FOR THEIR FILES IN ALL  PROJECTS  SHOULD  NOT  SEE  THESE
     FILES.   IF  EITHER  THE PROJECT IS EXPLICIT OR THE PROGRAMMER IS
     "*", THEN THE OLD BEHAVIOUR IS INDICATED.  THUS, [*,*] WILL STILL
     SEARCH ALL UFD'S.  NOTE THAT [?,X] WILL MATCH PROGRAMMER X IN ALL
     DIRECTORIES BELOW PROJECT 10.  NOTE ALSO, THAT THE BEHAVIOUR FROM
     [1,2] IS UNAFFECTED.

114  HANDLE [1,1].UFD CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER .UFD  HANDLING.   THIS
     ELIMINATES THE NOTATION OF #X0000YY.UFD[1,1].

115  CORRECT A BUG IN THE MFD CHKACC LOGIC.  THIS WAS UNCOVERED  BY  A
     BUG  IN  TWICE WHICH CAUSED STRANGE UFD PROTECTIONS, BUT THE CODE
     SHOULD BE CORRECT ANYWAY.

116  CORRECT BUG INTRODUCED BY 107.

117  ADD ENTRY POINT .CHKTA  FOR  DIRECT  TO  CHECK  THE  BEFORE/SINCE
     SWITCHES ON MAGTAPES.

120  CHANGE THE MODULE NAME FROM "WILD" TO ".WILD" TO AVOID  ANY  NAME
     CONFLICTS.

121  ADD SYMBOLS ".WILDZ" AND ".WILDL" FOR THE START AND LENGTH OF THE
     LOW SEGMENT AREA.

122  HANDLE NO MFD MESSAGE GRACEFULLY ("NON-EXISTENT MFD ON XXX:").

THE ONLY CHANGE IS TO CORRECT ONE BUG.  THIS BUG CAUSED WILD  TO  SKIP
THE LAST FILE IN EACH BLOCK OF THE DIRECTORY.

2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1 USER (CONSOLE) CHANGES

2.1.1 SUB-FILE DIRECTORIES ARE FULLY SUPPORTED.  IN PARTICULAR, UP  TO
FIVE  SFDS  MAY  BE SPECIFIED FOLLOWING THE PROJECT,PROGRAMMER NUMBER.
THESE SFDS MAY INCLUDE BOTH  *  AND  ?   WILD  CARDS.   THE  SFDS  ARE
SPECIFIED  IN SIXBIT SEPARATED BY COMMAS.  THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO REFER
TO THE FILE NAMED FOO.MAC WITHIN SFD XYZ WHICH RESIDES IN SFD  ABC  IN
AREA [10,612], ONE TYPES "FOO.MAC[10,612,ABC,XYZ]".

2.1.2 THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY SET BY SETSRC IS FULLY SUPPORTED.  THIS IS
NORMALLY  INVOKED  BY NOT SPECIFYING THE DIRECTORY IN THE COMMAND.  IF
IT IS  DESIRED  TO  SPECIFY  THE  DEFAULT  DIRECTORY  EXPLICITLY,  THE
NOTATION "[-]" MAY BE USED.

2.1.3 FOR CONVENIENCE, A DIRECTORY REFERENCE TO  A  DIRECTORY  IN  THE
USER'S  PROJECT OR HIS PROGRAMMER NUMBER MAY BE LEFT BLANK.  THUS [,7]
WHEN LOGGED IN AS [10,612], MEANS [10,7].  SIMILARLY, [11,] WOULD MEAN
[11,612].   THIS  ALSO  CAN BE USED WITH SFDS, SO THE EXAMPLE IN 2.1.1
CAN BE TYPED AS "FOO.MAC[,,ABC,XYZ]".  IF THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY IS NOT
THE  USER'S  LOGGED  IN UFD, HIS UFD CAN BE REFERENCED AS "[,]".  NOTE
THAT THESE NOTATIONS USE  THE  USER'S  LOGGED  IN  PROJECT  PROGRAMMER
NUMBER, NOT HIS DEFAULT DIRECTORY.

2.1.4 A DEFICIENCY IN VERSION 1 HAS BEEN FIXED.  THE NOTATION  "+"  IS
USED  TO  COMBINE  SEVERAL SPECIFICATIONS INTO ONE WILD CARD SCAN.  IT
REPRESENTS AN OR FUNCTION.  FOR EXAMPLE, A.B+C.D MEANS ANY FILE  NAMED
A.B  OR  C.D.  IN VERSION 1, THIS DID NOT WORK FOR UFDS.  IN VERSION 2
IT WORKS FOR ALL CASES.

2.1.5 (SER 1567) WILD  NOW  HANDLES  CONTROLLER  CLASS  ABBREVIATIONS,
CONTROLLER  ABBREVIATIONS, AND STRUCTURE ABBREVIATIONS.  THIS IS FULLY
COMPATIBLE WITH THE FILSER INTERPRETATION OF THESE ABBREVIATIONS.

2.1.6 REPORTING OF DIRECTORY LOOKUP ERRORS IS DEFERRED TO THE  END  OF
LOOKING  AT  ALL STRUCTURES.  THUS, IF AN SFD OR UFD IS MISSING ON ONE
STRUCTURE,  BUT  PRESENT  ON  ANOTHER  STRUCTURE,  NO  ERROR  WILL  BE
GENERATED.  THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE FILSER INTERPRETATION.

2.1.7 THE OPEN FAILURE MESSAGE NOW INCLUDES A QUESTION MARK TO MAKE IT
FATAL.   IF POSSIBLE, IT ALSO INCLUDES THE JOB NUMBER OF THE JOB WHICH
IS USING THE DEVICE.

2.1.8 THE FILSER LOOKUP ERROR CODE 24 IS SUPPORTED.  THIS CODE HAPPENS
IF  THE  JOB'S  SEARCH  LIST  IS  EMPTY.  WILD VERSION 1 DETECTED THIS
ITSELF FOR WILD CARD LOOKUPS, BUT IT DEPENDS  ON  FILSER  IF  NO  WILD
CARDS ARE INDICATED.
WILD.DOC -- CHANGES FROM V1 TO V2                              Page 17


2.1.9 THE DIRECTORY WILD CARDING WORKS AS FOLLOWS.  A FILE IS A  MATCH
ONLY   IF   IT  APPEARS  AT  THE  DEPTH  INDICATED  BY  THE  DIRECTORY
SPECIFICATION OR IF 0 MATCHES THE NEXT DEEPER DIRECTORY SPECIFICATION.
THUS,  IF  THE  USER  TYPES  "[1,2,A,*,C]",  FILES  WILL MATCH ONLY IN
[1,2,A] (SINCE 0 MATCHES *) AND IN  [1,2,A,*,C]  (SINCE  THIS  IS  THE
BOTTOM LEVEL).

2.1.10 SPECIAL HANDLING IS PERFORMED WHEN THE USER SPECIFIES  .UFD  AS
THE  EXTENSION.   IN THIS CASE, THE PROJECT-PROGRAMMER NUMBER FROM THE
DIRECTORY (AFTER DEFAULTING) IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE FILE NAME AND  THE
DIRECTORY IS SET TO BE THE MFD (1,1).

2.1.11 WHEN THE MONITOR DOES A LOOKUP ON  DEVICES  SUCH  AS  SYS:   OR
HLP:, IT IGNORES THE DIRECTORY SPECIFICATION UNLESS IT TURNS OUT TO BE
A LOGICAL DEVICE NAME.  WILD DOES THE SAME THING.



2.2 CALLER (PROGRAM) CHANGES

2.2.1 WILD NOW OBSERVES THE STANDARD CALLING CONVENTIONS.  ACS 1-4 ARE
TEMP AND 5 IS PRESERVED.  PARAMETERS ARE PASSED TO IT VIA A POINTER IN
AC 1.  THE INDEX TO THE SCAN BLOCK WHICH MATCHED THE REQUEST IS STORED
IN A LOCATION SELECTED BY THE CALLER.

2.2.2 WILD HAS BEEN UPDATED TO USE THE  REVISED  TYPEOUT  ROUTINES  IN
SCAN  VERSION  2.   THE  CALLING  SEQUENCE  TO THESE ROUTINES HAS BEEN
CHANGED TO PASS THE VALUE IN AC 1.

2.2.3 DIRECTORIES ARE LISTED BY CALLING THE NEW  ROUTINE  (.TDIRB)  IN
SCAN  VERSION  2.  THIS ROUTINE HANDLES SFD FORMAT AND SCAN FORMAT FOR
THE TYPEOUT.

2.2.4 ALL DIRECTORY READING IS NOW ON CHANNEL 0, WHICH IS  ASSUMED  TO
BE  A  SCRATCH  CHANNEL.  BECAUSE OF THIS, ALL DIRECTORIES ARE READ IN
DUMP MODE.

2.2.5 THE DATA READ ROUTINE (.NXDTW) NOW USES A  CHANNEL  SELECTED  BY
THE CALLING PROGRAM.  THE DATA CHANNEL IS NOW OPENED BY THE CALLER.

2.2.6 THE FLAG (.WLDFL) WHICH INDICATES WILDCARD  VS.   MULTIPLE  STRS
VS.   SIMPLE  LOOKUP,  NOW  HAS  A  FOURTH STATE-- VALUE -2 MEANS BOTH
MULTIPLE STRS AND WILDCARD.

2.2.7 THE LOOKUP BLOCK IS NOW RETURNED IN A CORE BLOCK POINTED TO FROM
THE ARGUMENT BLOCK.  THIS IS SETUP IN STANDARD EXTENDED LOOKUP FORMAT.

2.2.8 A ROUTINE (.CHKTM) HAS BEEN ADDED WHICH WILL VALIDATE THE FILE'S
CREATION  TIME  AND  DATE AGAINST THE /BEFORE AND /SINCE SWITCHES FROM
SCAN.  (THESE SWITCHES ARE NOT SUPPORTED IN SCAN VERSION 2).

5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES


5.1 C.MAC AND SCNMAC.MAC  ARE  USED  FOR  ALL  MONITOR  AND  PARAMETER
SPECIFICATIONS.

5.2 ALL DIRECTORY READS ARE VALIDATED BY THE CHKACC UUO.  THIS REMOVES
A  DEFICIENCY  IN  QUEUE  WHICH  ALLOWED  THE  USER  TO LIST PROTECTED
DIRECTORIES.  THUS WILD CAN NOW BE USED IN ANY  PROGRAM  RUNNING  WITH
JACCT TURNED ON.

5.3 THE INDEX POINTER TO THE FILE SPEC AREA IS NOW IN P1 (AC 5).

5.4 THE DIRECTORY READING CODE HAS BEEN  REWRITTEN.   IT  NOW  HANDLES
UFDS  AND SFDS IN ONE ROUTINE.  WHEN A UFD OR SFD IS FOUND, THE SEARCH
WILL DROP DOWN INTO THAT DIRECTORY IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY  FOR  A
MATCH.   AT  END  OF  DIRECTORY,  THE SEARCH WILL RETURN UP ONE LEVEL.
LEVELS OF THE DIRECTORY WITHOUT WILDCARDS  WILL  AVOID  THE  SCAN  AND
ASSUME THE RESULT IMMEDIATELY.

5.5 NO SPRS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.  THE  ONLY  SER  WAS  1567,  WHICH  IS
ANSWERED.

5.6 WHEN WILD IS DONE WITH A DIRECTORY, IT DOES A  CLOSE  100  SO  THE
MONITOR   WILL   DELETE  THE  ACCESS  TABLES.   THIS  SHOULD  DECREASE
INTERFERENCE IN THE DORMANT ACCESS TABLES.
