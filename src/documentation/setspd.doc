October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

5-SETSPD  is  a  privileged  system  program   which   processes   the
5-CONFIG.CMD file and, in so doing, sets many initial parameters about
the system such as:  initial line speeds, system  logical  names,  and
magtape logical to physical correspondences.

5-SETSPD version 5(15) runs only on Release 5 of TOPS-20.

5-SETSPD depends on the file PS:<SYSTEM>5-CONFIG.CMD.

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

4.3  Files Needed to Build SETSPD

5-SETSPD is built from the following files:

     SETSPD.MAC
     SERCOD.UNV
     SERCOD.REL

In addition, the following files must be on SYS:

     MACREL.REL
     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building SETSPD

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND

typing in the appropriate commands.


4.5  Special Considerations

SETSPD is run automatically by the monitor  when  it  is  started  and
whenever  one  of  the  front  end  PDP11's  is reloaded.  It need not
however be run under timesharing.
