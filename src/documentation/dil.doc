INTRODUCTION


1.0  INTRODUCTION

This document describes  how  to  install  version  2.1  of  the  Data
Interchange  Library  (DIL) on a DECSYSTEM-20, DECsystem-10 or VAX/VMS
system.

This manual  is  intended  for  the  system  manager  responsible  for
installing and maintaining the DIL.

You can find additional information in the DIL User Reference Manual.



2.0  SUMMARY

The Data Interchange Library (DIL)  is  a  set  of  subroutines  which
provide  some  basic  capabilities  for distributed applications.  The
capabilities include moving ASCII and binary data between  similar  or
dissimilar  systems,  and  converting between data formats in the same
class (string, fixed point  integer  (including  binary  fixed  point,
packed decimal and display numeric types), and floating point).  These
routines are callable from COBOL and FORTRAN on TOPS-10, TOPS-20,  and
VAX/VMS systems.

On TOPS-20 systems, DIL Version 2.1 will run under TOPS-20 version 5.1
or  later monitors and under TOPS-20 version 4.1 or later monitors for
2020 processors.  On VAX systems, DIL Version 2.1 will run  under  VMS
3.1  or  later monitors.  On TOPS-10 systems, DIL Version 2.1 will run
under TOPS-10 version 7.02 or later monitors.

Refer to the beware file, DIL.BWR, for hints and potential problems.



3.0  PRODUCT SOURCES

The DIL V2.1 kit contains product sources in  machine  readable  form.
These  sources  are included only as a reference and are not warranted
or supported by Digital Equipment Corporation.

EXTERNAL CHANGES


4.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The following new functions were added to DIL for Version 2.1.

      o  DATA CONVERSION -- TOPS-10, TOPS-20 and VAX/VMS

         The data conversion routines have been  expanded  to  include
         two  new  data  classes:   packed decimal and display numeric
         types.

         Cross class conversion is now provided between all  types  of
         fixed point integer data.  Fixed point binary, packed decimal
         and display numeric classes can  all  be  converted  to  each
         other.

      o  TASK-TO-TASK and REMOTE FILE ACCESS -- TOPS-10

         The full set of task-to-task and remote file access  routines
         is  now  provided  for  TOPS-10  systems.   Previously, these
         routines were available for only TOPS-20 and VAX/VMS systems.
         DIL  Version  2.1  can be used in a network that supports any
         combination of VAX/VMS, TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 systems.

      o  TASK-TO-TASK ROUTINES -- TOPS-10, TOPS-20 and VAX/VMS

         Two new  task-to-task  functions  have  been  added  for  all
         supported systems:
             

             Send a single interrupt data message over a logical link.
             

             Receive a single interrupt data message  over  a  logical
             link.


      o  DOCUMENTATION

         A new manual was provided with DIL Version 2.0.




5.0  COMPATIBILITY WITH DIL V1.0

You can  use  DIL  V2.1  with  any  of  your  DIL  V1.0  or  DIL  V2.0
applications.

DIL.REL is the library to search when linking programs with the DIL.

DIL.LIB is a COBOL copy library  containing  statements  which  define
names  for  various special codes used to select options and the like.
Elements in DIL.LIB may be COPY'd into user programs as  described  in
the  DIL manual.  DIL.LIB is not needed if your site will not be using
the DIL from COBOL programs.

DILV7.FOR,  DIXV7.FOR,  DITV7.FOR:   These  files  are   the   FORTRAN
equivalent  of  the  COBOL  copy library members contained in DIL.LIB,
above.  They may be INCLUDE'd into user programs to define  names  for
DIL  codes.   The  files are for use with TOPS-20 FORTRAN Version 7 or
later.  Details on when and how to include them, and how  to  use  the
codes,  are  given  in  the  DIL documentation.  None of the files are
necessary unless explicitly referenced  from  user  programs  (or  the
installation verification procedure).

B362LB.REL is the run-time support library for  BLISS.   Install  this
only  if  you  don't already have BLISS Version 3 or Version 4 on your
system.

XPORT.REL is a transportable support library needed by the  DIL  code.

DECSYSTEM-20 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


7.1.4  Fourth Save Set:  REL Files -

These files are necessary to rebuild DIL with patches.  In particular,
this save set includes the files necessary to apply autopatch tapes to
the DIL.  These files should  be  installed  into  the  DIL  autopatch
directory.

     DIL2V2.REL
     DIT2V2.REL
     DIX2V2.REL
     DAP2V1.REL
     XPN2V1.REL



7.1.5  Fifth Save Set:  Installation Verification Files -

The following files are provided for installation verification:

      o  C36T2.CBL -- COBOL data conversion test
      o  CD36T1.CBL -- COBOL remote file access test
      o  CT36T1.CBL -- COBOL task-to-task test
      o  F7T2.FOR -- FORTRAN V7 data conversion test
      o  FD7T1.FOR -- FORTRAN V7 remote file access test
      o  FT7T1.FOR -- FORTRAN V7 task-to-task test
      o  ICSCBL.CTL -- COBOL verification control file
      o  ICSF7.CTL -- FORTRAN V7 verification control file




7.2  DECSYSTEM-20 Installation

The first step in installation should be to restore the files from the
documentation  save-set  to  disk,  and  read  DIL.DOC (this file) and
DIL.BWR.

This can be done by setting  MTA0:   unavailable  to  MOUNTR  (if  you
normally use labelled tapes), mounting the distribution tape on MTA0:,
defining DOC:  as the directory into which you  want  to  restore  the
documentation files, and typing the following commands:

     DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600
     RESTORE PS:<*>*.* DOC:*.*.-1
     EXIT
     PRINT DOC:DIL.DOC, DOC:DIL.BWR

DIL.DOC -- V2.1(142) 25-Jul-86                                  Page 8
DECSYSTEM-20 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


After reading DIL.DOC and DIL.BWR, proceed with  the  installation  by
moving  the  help  file  to the help directory, and then restoring the
appropriate files from the tape to SYS:, as follows:

     COPY DOC:DIL.HLP HLP:
     DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE PS:<*>DIL.LIB SYS:*.*.-1, -
       PS:<*>DIL.REL SYS:*.*.-1, -
       PS:<*>DILV7.FOR SYS:*.*.-1, -
       PS:<*>DITV7.FOR SYS:*.*.-1, -
       PS:<*>DIXV7.FOR SYS:*.*.-1
     EXIT

There are two special files that may or may  not  be  needed  on  your
system.   Please refer to the discussion above in section "Second Save
set:  SUBSYS Files," and the  discussion  below  in  section  "Special
Considerations  (TOPS-20)."  To restore both of them to SYS:, type the
following commands:

     DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE PS:<*>B362LB.REL SYS:*.*.-1, -
       PS:<*>XPORT.REL SYS:*.*.-1
     EXIT


To be able to run the  installation  certification  system,  you  must
restore additional files.  Mount the tape on MTA0:, define DILTST:  to
point to the directory you want to put the ICS files  in  (we  suggest
PS:<DIL-TEST>;   see  6.0, "Installation Verification System," below),
and type the following commands:

     DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:

DECSYSTEM-20 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


To be able to apply autopatch to the DIL, you must install  the  files
listed  below  into  the  DIL autopatch library directory, referred to
below by logical name DILAP:.   This  may  be  done  by  mounting  the
distribution tape on MTA0:, defining DILAP:  to point to the directory
you wish to restore the files into, and typing the following commands:

     DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     SKIP 3

To install the DIL sources for TOPS-20, mount the distribution tape on
MTA0:,  define  DILSRC:  to point to the directory you wish to restore
the sources into, and type the following commands:

     DUMPER

7.3  Special Considerations

The  B362LB.REL   (BLISS   run-time   library)   and   the   XPORT.REL
(transportable  support  library) shipped with the DIL are the current
field-image versions;  if you have BLISS Version  3  or  4  installed,
there is no need to install either of these two files.

8.1.1  Documentation -

DIL.BWR contains hints and information about potential problems.

DIL.DOC is this file.

DIL.HLP is the help file for TOPS-10/TOPS-20.

The following programs make up the DIL sample application.  These  are
provided   as   examples   only.   They  will  not  run  without  some

8.1.2  Libraries And Interface Support Files -

DIL.REL is the library to search when linking programs with the DIL.

DIL.LIB is a COBOL copy library  containing  statements  which  define
names  for  various special codes used to select options and the like.
Elements in DIL.LIB may be COPY'd into user programs as  described  in
the  DIL manual.  DIL.LIB is not needed if your site will not be using
the DIL from COBOL programs.

DILV7.FOR,  DIXV7.FOR,  DITV7.FOR:   These  files  are   the   FORTRAN
equivalent  of  the  COBOL  copy library members contained in DIL.LIB,
above.  They may be INCLUDE'd into user programs to define  names  for
DIL  codes.   The  files are for use with TOPS-10 FORTRAN Version 7 or
later.  Details on when and how to include them, and how  to  use  the
codes,  are  given  in  the  DIL documentation.  None of the files are
necessary unless explicitly referenced  from  user  programs  (or  the
installation verification procedure).

B361LB.REL is a necessary run-time support library.  You  should  only
install  this  if  you  do not have Version 3 or Version 4 of BLISS-36
installed on your system.

XPORT.REL is a transportable support library needed by the  DIL  code.
You should only install this if you do not have Version 3 or Version 4
of BLISS-36 on your system.

8.2  DECsystem-10 Installation

To install DIL Version 2.1 on your system,  copy  the  files  DIL.REL,
DIL.LIB, DILV7.FOR, DIXV7.FOR, DITV7.FOR from the distribution tape to
SYS:.  If you will not be using the DIL from  COBOL,  DIL.LIB  may  be
omitted.   If  you  will  not be using the DIL from FORTRAN, the *.FOR
files may be omitted.

If you do not have BLISS-36 Version 3 or Version 4 installed  on  your
system,  copy  the  file  B361LB.REL  to  SYS:.   See section "Special
Considerations (TOPS-10)" below.

If you do not have BLISS-36 Version 3 or Version 4 installed  on  your
system,  copy  the  file  XPORT.REL to SYS:.  See the section "Special
Considerations (TOPS-10)" below.

The autopatch library files for the DIL  are  DIL1V2.REL,  DIX1V2.REL,
DIT1V2.REL, DAP1V1.REL, XPN1V1.REL.  These should be restored from the
distribution tape to the autopatch library directory you establish for
DIL.

The  Installation  Verification  System  is  contained  in  the  files
ICSCBL.CTL,  ICSF7.CTL,  C36T2.CBL,  CD36T1.CBL, CT36T1.CBL, F7T2.FOR,
FD7T1.FOR, FT7T1.FOR.  These should be restored to some  directory  if
you  intend  to  run  the  installation  verification  system.   It is
recommended  that  you  use  the  directory  UTP:   ([5,33]).   It  is
recommended  that  you  run the installation verification system.  See
see 6.0, "Installation Verification System," below,  for  instructions
on running the installation verification.

8.3  Special Considerations

The  B361LB.REL   (BLISS   run-time   library)   and   the   XPORT.REL
(transportable  support  library) shipped with the DIL are the current
field-image versions;  if you have BLISS-36 Version  3  or  Version  4
installed, there is no need to install either of these two files.

9.0  VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



                              IMPORTANT

               You must  have  VMS  V3.1  or  later  to
               install this kit.





9.1  CONVENTIONS

The following conventions are  used  in  this  document,  and  in  the
VMSINSTAL procedure:

[]      
        Square brackets enclose default answers to
        questions VMSINSTAL asks you throughout the
        installation procedure.  To give the default
        answer to a question, simply press the RETURN
        key.




9.2  VAX DIL INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

Read this entire section carefully before you attempt to  install  VAX
DIL.  The installation procedure should take less than 45 minutes.



9.2.1  Components Of The VAX DIL Facility -

An installed VAX DIL facility consists of:

      o  The library of Data Interchange routines, DIL.OLB.

      o  The sharable image format of the library,  DIL.EXE,  and  the
         LINKER options file to link with the sharable image, DIL.OPT.

      o  The text library for the Interface Support files, DIL.TLB.

      o  The message files, DITMSG.EXE and DIXMSG.EXE.

      o  The file DILTFR.OBJ which defines VMS  transfer  vectors  for
         DIL entry points.
DIL.DOC -- V2.1(142) 25-Jul-86                                 Page 18
VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


      o  XPORT.OLB, which is necessary for DIL and is  installed  only
         if it does not already exist on your system.

      o  The DIL Beware file, DIL.BWR.

      o  The DIL sources for VAX/VMS.  These sources are provided  for
         reference  only and are not warranted or supported by Digital
         Equipment Corporation.




9.2.2  The Installation Procedure -

The VAX DIL kit installs the shared image, the executable images,  and
their  associated files.  The kit also installs XPORT.OLB if it is not
present on your system.

This installation procedure:

      o  Verifies that VMS V3.1 or later is running and that there are
         at least 3000 free blocks for the installation to use.

      o  Copies the installation  kit  from  the  kit  medium  to  the
         installation medium.

      o  Installs the VAX DIL  images,  message  files  and  XPORT  if
         necessary.

      o  Installs the beware file and installs the help file into  the
         system help library.

      o  Checks to see if FORTRAN is installed and,  if  so,  compiles
         and  runs  the  FORTRAN  IVP  tests.   You  will  need SYSNAM
         privilege to successfully run the FORTRAN IVP tests.

      o  Checks to see if COBOL is installed and, if so, compiles  and
         runs  the COBOL IVP tests.  You will need SYSNAM privilege to
         successfully run the COBOL IVP tests.

      o  Optionally purges prior versions of the VAX DIL facility from
         your system.

      o  Deletes the files comprising this kit from  the  installation
         medium.

VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


9.2.3  Installing VAX DIL -

The VAX/VMS DIL product kit is a  standard  BACKUP  save  set,  called
DIL021.A.   You  should  use  the  standard VMSINSTAL.COM procedure to
install the VAX Data Interchange library kit.

The VAX DIL installation consists of three phases.   During  phase  1,
VMSINSTAL  copies  the  DIL  V2.1  kit  from  the  kit  media  to  the
installation device.  During phase 2,  VMSINSTAL  asks  you  questions
about  the installation and installs the DIL images and files.  During
phase 3, VMSINSTAL runs the Installation Verification Procedure.

You will need to be logged into an account which has SYSNAM  privilege
in  order to successfully run the Installation Verification Procedure.
If  an  Installation  Verification  program  fails  with  error   code
15302676, make sure you have SYSNAM privilege.

To install the VAX DIL you should:

     1.  Log into a system  account  (and  be  sure  you  have  SYSNAM
         privilege).

     2.  Execute the VMSINSTAL.COM procedure.

     3.  Mount the VAX DIL kit media.

     4.  Respond to the questions asked by the installation  procedure
         and VMSINSTAL.




9.2.4  Running The VMSINSTAL.COM Procedure -

After you have logged into a system account and have assured that  you
have  SYSNAM  privilege,  use  this  DCL  command to run the VMSINSTAL
procedure:

@SYS_$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DIL021 dilu:


where dilu:  is the physical name of the device on which you mount the
kit  media.   VMSINSTAL  prompts  you for this parameter if you do not
include it.

VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


9.2.5  Phase 1:  Copying The Kit To The Installation Device -

During Phase 1, VMSINSTAL:

      o  Asks you if you need to backup the system disk.

      o  Asks you the name of the device on which the kit  media  will
         be  mounted  (only if you did not specify dilu:  as described
         in 9.2.4

      o  Asks you the names of the products you wish to install  (only
         if you did not specify DIL021 as described in 9.2.4.

      o  Copies the kit from the kit media to the installation device.




9.2.5.1  Backing Up The System Disk -

VMSINSTAL first asks you the following question:

* Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?


If you have not backed up your system disk, you  should  not  continue
with  the  installation  until  you do so.  If you need to back up the
system disk, type "N." VMSINSTAL exits and  returns  you  to  the  DCL
prompt.  Back up your system disk, and then start VMSINSTAL again.

If you have already backed up the system disk, type "Y" and press  the
RETURN key or simply press the RETURN key.

See the  appropriate  VMS  software  installation  guide  in  the  VMS
documentation   set   for   more   information   on   backups   before
installations.  For general information on backups,  see  the  VAX/VMS
Utilities Reference Manual.



9.2.5.2  Specifying The Device Name -

If you did not specify a physical device name on the DCL command line,
VMSINSTAL   asks  you  for  the  name  of  the  device  on  which  the
distribution media will be mounted.

* Where will the distribution volumes be mounted:

Type in the physical device name of the appropriate  drive  and  press
RETURN.   You  must  enter  the  physical device name according to the
format:

        dilu:

VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS






9.2.5.3  Specifying The Product Name -

If you did not specify them on the command line,  VMSINSTAL  will  ask
you  for  the names of the products you wish to install from the first
volume of the distribution media:

* Products [EXIT]:

In response to this prompt, type:

        DIL021




9.2.5.4  Copying The Kit Onto The Installation Device -

VMSINSTAL then  instructs  you  to  mount  the  first  volume  of  the
distribution volume set on the proper device.  VMSINSTAL then asks:

* Are you ready?

After you have mounted the volume on the proper device, answer "Y."

VMSINSTAL then prints the following messages:

The following products will be installed:

  DIL    V2.1


           Beginning installation of DIL V2.1 at hh:mm

%VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

After VMSINSTAL has restored the entire kit, Phase 1 is  complete  and
Phase 2 begins.



9.2.6  Phase 2:  The Installation -

Before VMSINSTAL installs the DIL images, message  files,  help  file,
source,  etc.,  it  asks  you  if  you  would  like to purge the files
replaced by this installation.  After you have answered this question,
VMSINSTAL will perform the installation for you.

VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


9.2.6.1  Deciding Whether To PURGE Files -

VMSINSTAL will ask you the following question:

* Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?


If you would like VMSINSTAL  to  purge  the  files  replaced  by  this
installation,  type  "Y"  and press the RETURN key or simply press the
return key.  If you do not want VMSINSTAL to purge the files  replaced
by this installation, type "N" and press the RETURN key.



9.2.6.2  Sources -

After  you  have  answered  the  question  about  purging  files,  the
following message will appear:

    This kit contains a complete set of DIL sources for VMS. They will
    be installed on the system device in directory [DIL]. If this
    directory does not presently exist, this installation procedure
    will create it.  


The DIL VAX sources  will  all  be  installed  in  the  system  device
directory [DIL].  If that directory does not exist, it will be created
for you.  You do not  need  to  worry  about  creating  the  directory
yourself.   When  the directory is created, you will see the following
message:

%VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system directory [DIL].

If the system device directory [DIL] already exists, you will see  the
following message:

%CREATE-I-EXISTS, VMI$ROOT:[DIL] alreay exists



                                 NOTE

               The sources are provided for the VAX/VMS
               DIL product.  These sources are provided
               for reference only and are not warranted
               or   supported   by   Digital  Equipment

9.2.6.3  The Installation -

After the system device directory [DIL]  is  created  (if  necessary),
VMSINSTAL  will  perform  the  installation for you.  You will see the
following message from the installation procedure:

  This package includes a copy of the DIL Beware file (called DIL.BWR)
  which will be placed in SYS_$UPDATE.


Next, VMSINSTAL will print the following message:

%VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories... 


At this point the installation is completed and the IVP can be run.



9.2.7  Phase 3:  The Installation Verification Procedure -


                                 NOTE


               In   order    for    the    Installation
               Verification procedure to be useful, you
               should  have  either  COBOL  or  FORTRAN
               installed on your system.



Once the installation has completed, VMSINSTAL will run  the  IVP  for
you.  First, you will see the following message:

  WARNING:  You need SYSNAM privilege to run the Installation
            Verification Procedure.  If you do not have SYSNAM
            privilege, certain programs will fail with the
            error code 15302676.


If you are logged into an account which does not have SYSNAM privilege
then  you  will  not  be  able  to  successfully  run  some of the IVP
programs.  You should not run the installation unless you  are  logged
into an account which has SYSNAM privilege.

Next you will see the following message:

  Please wait while the installation verification is run...

which signifies that the IVP procedure has started.

VAX/VMS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


Since the Data Interchange Library is callable from COBOL and FORTRAN,
the  IVP consists of a set of COBOL test programs and a set of FORTRAN
test programs.



9.2.7.1  The COBOL IVP Tests -

The IVP first checks to see if COBOL is installed on your system.  You
will see the following message:

  First, let's see if you have COBOL installed on your system.

The IVP will simply do a directory  of  SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSEXE]COBOL.EXE.
If the file is there, then you will see the following message:

  Since COBOL is installed on your system, the COBOL IVP tests
  will be run.

and then the COBOL IVP is run.  The COBOL test programs are  compiled,
linked and then executed.

If the COBOL tests are run, you will see the following output from the
programs:

INSTALLATION VERIFICATION SYSTEM


10.0  INSTALLATION VERIFICATION SYSTEM

The Installation Verification System is a set of batch control  files.
Each  of  these batch control files contains commands to compile, link
and run the programs which have been provided with the DIL to  perform
Installation Verification.  There are batch control files for TOPS-10,
TOPS-20 and VAX/VMS systems.  For each of the supported  languages  on
each  of  these  systems  there is one installation verification batch
control file.  On VAX/VMS systems, the  installation  verification  is
run for you, automatically, by the VMSINSTAL command procedure.

A list of the the batch control files for  each  language  and  system
combination follows:

TOPS-20 files:             Language:

        ICSCBL.CTL         COBOL
        ICSF7.CTL          FORTRAN

TOPS-10 files:             Language:

        ICSCBL.CTL         COBOL
        ICSF7.CTL          FORTRAN

VAX/VMS files:             Language:

        ICSCOB.COM         COBOL
        ICSFOR.COM         FORTRAN

The programs which are  supplied  for  installation  verification  run
minimal tests on each set of the DIL routines provided for each of the
supported language/system combination.  The sets  of  routines  tested
are:   (1) Data Conversion (2) Remote File Access and (3) Task-to-Task
routines.

A list of the programs for each system and the set  of  routines  they
test (and the control file which runs them) is below:

All of the test programs use the DIL Interface Support files.

The task-to-task and  remote  file  access  installation  verification
programs use only the local network node.

The DIL must be installed in accordance with the instructions provided
with  the  DIL.  If it is not, the Installation Verification system is
irrelevant.

INSTALLATION VERIFICATION SYSTEM


10.1  TOPS-20 Installation Verification

On TOPS-20, the Installation Verification System consists of two batch
control  files;   one  for COBOL and one for FORTRAN.  To run the test
system, you simply run  the  batch  control  files  using  the  SUBMIT
command,  wait  for  the  batch  job  to  finish, and then examine the
resulting batch log file.  Before you run any  of  the  TOPS-20  batch
streams  you  should read this section and the section above to ensure
that the test streams run properly.

For all of the TOPS-20 Installation Verification System batch streams,
you  will  need  a VALID login directory called PS:<DIL-TEST> with the
password DIL-TEST.  If this directory is not set up properly, some  of
the  test  programs  will fail.  If your system is set up with account
validation  enabled,  then  you  must  ensure   that   the   directory
PS:<DIL-TEST>   has  a  valid  account  default  for  login  set,  and
PS:<SYSTEM>ACCOUNTS-TABLE.BIN reflects that  this  account  is  indeed
valid  specifically for the directory PS:<DIL-TEST>.  (You may specify
any  valid  account  default  for  login  that  you  wish.)  For  more
information  on  account  validation,  see the TOPS-20 System Managers
Guide.

The  directory  PS:<DIL-TEST>  does  not   require   any   privileges.
Permanent and working disk quotas of 500 or more blocks are required.

If you do not want to use the directory PS:<DIL-TEST> you will have to
edit  the files listed below to change the directory name and password
to one of your choice:

         CD36T1.CBL
         FD7T1.FOR
         ICSCBL.CTL
         ICSF7.CTL


The programs that test DIT routines will exercise the FALs.  If  there
is  not  a FAL free for the program to use, it will die with the error
DIT-NETOPRFAIL (return code values 61210656 through 61210660).

To run the Installation Verification type the following commands:
        @SUBMIT ICSCBL.CTL
        @SUBMIT ICSF7.CTL

10.2  TOPS-10 Installation Verification

On TOPS-10, the Installation Verification System consists of two batch
control  files;   one  for COBOL and one for FORTRAN.  To run the test
system, you simply run  the  batch  control  files  using  the  SUBMIT
command,  wait  for  the  batch  job  to  finish, and then examine the
resulting batch log file.  Before you run any  of  the  TOPS-10  batch
streams  you  should read this section to ensure that the test streams
run properly.

For all of the TOPS-10 Installation Verification System batch streams,
you  will need a VALID PPN called [5,33] with the password DILTST.  If
this directory is not set up properly, some of the test programs  will
fail.

The PPN [5,33] does not require any privileges.  Disk quotas  of  1100
blocks or more are required.

If you do not want to use the PPN [5,33] you will  have  to  edit  the
files listed below to change the directory name and password to one of
your choice:

         CD36T1.CBL
         FD7T1.FOR

INSTALLATION VERIFICATION SYSTEM


10.3  VAX/VMS Installation Verification

On VAX/VMS systems, the installation  verification  procedure  is  run
automatically  by  the  VMSINSTAL command procedure.  The installation
verification procedure checks to see if COBOL  is  installed  on  your
system,  and  if it is, runs the COBOL tests.  Then a check is made to
see if FORTRAN is installed on your system, and if it is, the  FORTRAN
tests  are  run.   If  either language is NOT installed, the tests for
that language are skipped over.

You will need SYSNAM privilege to run  the  Installation  Verification
Procedure.   If  you  do not have the SYSNAM privilege, certain of the
Installation Verification tests will fail with error code 15302676.

See  section  8.2.7  for  more  information  about  the  VAX/VMS   DIL
Installation Verification procedure.

DATA INTERCHANGE LIBRARY SAMPLE APPLICATION


13.0  DATA INTERCHANGE LIBRARY SAMPLE APPLICATION

13.1  Description

The Data Interchange Library Sample Application is a distributed COBOL
application  which  uses the Task-to-task, Remote File Access and Data
Conversion routines of the DIL.

The application is a "Labor Ticket"  collection  system.   It  enables
each  employee  to enter weekly time card information from a terminal,
either on a  VAX,  a  DECSYSTEM-20,  or  a  DECsystem-10.   The  labor
information  collected  from remote and local terminals is stored in a
file on the DECSYSTEM-20, or  DECsystem-10,  depending  on  where  the
server is running.  A summary report, in the form of a sequential file
stored on the VAX, is written from a separate report  program  on  the
DECSYSTEM-20, or DECsystem-10.  Before running the sample application,
the program IDXINI.CBL should  be  run  on  the  DECSYSTEM-20  or  the
DECsystem-10  where  the  server is going to be running.  This program
initializes the indexed sequential data file used by the application.

The server program (JTSERV.CBL) can serve multiple users and therefore
has  the  capability  to  open  four  or  six  network  links.   (On a
DECSYSTEM-20,  a  process  which  is  running  without  enabled  WHEEL
privileges  can  only  open  four links.  If the process is an enabled
WHEEL, then six links will be opened.  PROCES.MAC checks  the  process
running  the  server  program to see if it is an enables WHEEL and can
therefore open six rather than four links.  PROCES is called from  the
server.   On  a  DECsystem-10,  PROCES.MAC checks to see if the job is
running under [1,2].) The server program opens passive links and waits
for connect events from remote tasks.  The terminal interface programs
(JTTERM.CBL which will run on either a DECSYSTEM-20 or a  DECsystem-10
and  JTTERM.COB  which  will  run  on  a  VAX/VMS system) are run from
terminals whenever a user wants to enter in labor ticket information.

When a user starts up the terminal interface program  on  his  system,
that  program  attempts  to connect to the remote server program.  The
server then accepts the link.  The  user  at  the  terminal  interface
program can then request to update labor ticket information or to exit
the program.  If an update is  requested,  the  employee's  badge  (or
identification)  number  is  collected  and  sent  to the server.  The
server will then query the data  file  to  see  if  the  badge  number
presently  exists.   The  server  will  send a message to the terminal
interface program with the result of the query.   The  user  can  then
continue  or  abort  the  update.   If  the  update  is continued, the
remainder of the labor ticket information is collected and sent to the
server to be stored.  Otherwise, the server is sent a message to abort
this particular update.  Once the update is finished (or aborted), the
user can then update again or exit.

The  report  program  (JTVRPT.CBL)  runs  on  the   DECSYSTEM-20,   or
DECsystem-10 and writes a remote file onto a VAX.  It is not a part of
the Task-to-task process described above.  It  can  be  run  at  will,
either in batch or from a user terminal.

13.2  Running The Sample Application

To run the DIL Sample Application on your systems, you must first edit
the  programs  to reflect the node names and directory names which you
choose to use.  Once you have finished editing, you should compile and
link the DECSYSTEM-20 programs as follows:

@COBOL
COBOL>IDXINI.CBL
COBOL>JTSERV.CBL/STACK:2000
COBOL>JTTERM.CBL/STACK:2000
COBOL>JTVRPT.CBL/STACK:2000
COBOL>EXIT

@SAVE
@
@; initialize the data file JOBTIC.RMS
@RUN IDXINI
@

You should compile and link the DECsystem-10 programs as follows:

.r cbl74
*=IDXINI.CBL
*=JTSERV.CBL/D:2000
*=JTTERM.CBL/D:2000
*=JTVRPT.CBL/D:2000

.
.; initialize the data file JOBTIC.RMS
.run IDXINI
.

On the VAX, you should compile and link  the  VAX  terminal  interface
program as below:
$ cobol JTTERM.COB
$
$ link JTTERM,SYS$LIBRARY:DIL/LIB,SYS$LIBRARY:XPORT/LIB
$

Then, you should start the  server  program  on  the  DECSYSTEM-20  as
follows:

@run JTSERV

Or, you should  start  the  server  program  on  the  DECsystem-10  as
follows:

.run JTSERV

Once this is done, you can run the terminal  interface  programs  from
either your VAX, DECSYSTEM-20, or DECsystem-10.



14.0  BUILDING DIL

This is a brief explanation of how to build DIL on a TOPS-10,  TOPS-20
or VAX/VMS system.



15.0  BUILDING DIL ON TOPS-10

DIL.DOC -- V2.1(142) 25-Jul-86                                 Page 44
BUILDING DIL ON TOPS-10


                                 NOTE

               Before  you  attempt  to  build  DIL  on
               TOPS-10,  make  sure  you have Autopatch
               Tape 8,  or  later,  installed  on  your
               system.



To build DIL  on  TOPS-10,  customers  should  submit  DIL.CTL.   This
control  file  submits  the  following  batch jobs in the order listed
below, with the switches specified:

   o  SUBMIT EXT1A.CTL/TIME/RESTART:YES/TAG:RENG
   o  SUBMIT XPN1A.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES/TAG:RENG
   o  SUBMIT DAP1A.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES/TAG:RENG
   o  SUBMIT DXCM10.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES
   o  SUBMIT DLCM10.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES/TAG:RENG
   o  SUBMIT DTCM10.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES
   o  SUBMIT DLMK10.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES/TAG:RENG
   o  SUBMIT INTR10.CTL/DEPEND:1/TIME/RESTART:YES

After the batch jobs  finish  processing,  check  the  log  files  for
errors.

On TOPS-10 (only) there is a BLISS bug which causes request blocks  to
be generated with references to specific disk structure names and UICs
of certain library files required by BLISS.   Since  not  all  systems
have  the  same  disk  structure names as the system used for building
DIL, it is necessary to patch the DIL.REL once the build is complete.

If you are building DIL for use on a single  system,  you  can  ignore
this  patching process.  However, if you intend to move DIL to another
DECsystem-10 with different  structure  names,  you  must  patch  your
version of DIL.

In order to patch the DIL.REL file  the  following  procedure  can  be
used.

First, determine which disk structure name  has  been  hardcoded  into
your  DIL.REL  file.   One  way  to do this is to copy the DIL.REL you
built onto a system with different structure names, and trying to link
a  DIL  application  program  there with the DIL.REL.  The LINKER will
question you about the invalid  structure  name.   For  this  example,
assume  it  is  DSKA:   that is discovered to be the invalid structure
name.  It will be necessary to change  any  occurances  of  "DSKA"  to
"SYS"  in  DIL.REL.  In order to do this, all the occurances of "DSKA"
must first be located.

To find  the  address  of  every  occurance  of  "DSKA",  perform  the
following command sequence:

        .R FILDDT
DIL.DOC -- V2.1(142) 25-Jul-86                                 Page 45
BUILDING DIL ON TOPS-10


        File: DIL.REL/D
        <ESC>"/DSKA/<ESC>w   ;search for all occurrences of "DSKA"


This command sequence will search for all  occurrences  of  "DSKA"  in
SIXBIT.   To  tailor  this to your system, change the string "DSKA" in
the command sequence above to be the  structure  name  where  DIU  was
built.

After you type the command sequence above, FILDDT should  display  the
following sort of information:

        57227/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        64734/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        71701/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        76053/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        101027/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        102071/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        103651/   EQVM 7,410000(13)

        131315/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        132541/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        132613/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        137627/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        144672/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        146242/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        151473/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        152043/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        152411/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        156602/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        160006/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        160571/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        162037/   EQVM 7,410000(13)
        163223/   EQVM 7,410000(13)

You  have  now  isolated   the   addresses   of   the   culprit   DSKA
specifications.  Next, using the addresses you found above, you should
create a file called PATCH.DDT, which can be used by FILDDT  to  patch
the  product,  replacing  "DSKA"  with "SYS" for each occurrence.  The
file should look something like the following:

        57227/<ESC>"/SYS/
        64734/<ESC>"/SYS/
        71701/<ESC>"/SYS/

        162037/<ESC>"/SYS/
        163223/<ESC>"/SYS/

Once you have created PATCH.DDT, submit a  batch  control  file  which
contains the following commands:

        .R FILDDT
        *DIL.REL/D/P
        =^[Y
        *PATCH.DDT
        =^Z


Once this control  file  has  successfully  finished  processing,  the
patching is complete.

               system.



To build DIL on TOPS-20, submit the following  control  files  in  the
following order, with the switches specified:

   o  SUBMIT EXT1A-DIL.CTL /TAG:COMBIN
   o  SUBMIT XPN1A-DIL.CTL /TAG:COMBIN /DEPEND:1 /TIME:00:10:00
   o  SUBMIT DAP1A-DIL.CTL /TAG:COMBIN /DEPEND:1 /TIME:00:10:00
   o  SUBMIT COMPDX.CTL /TAG:RENG /DEPEND:1 /TIME:00:15:00

   o  SUBMIT COMPDT.CTL /TAG:RENG /DEPEND:1
   o  SUBMIT MAKDIL.CTL /TAG:RENG /DEPEND:1
   o  SUBMIT INTERFILS.CTL /TAG:RENG /DEPEND:1

After the batch jobs  finish  processing,  check  the  log  files  for
errors.



17.0  BUILDING DIL ON VAX/VMS



                                 NOTE

               Before you attempt to  build  DIL  on  a
               VAX/VMS  system,  make sure you have VMS
               Version 3.1 or later installed  on  your
               system.



The file BUILD.COM can be used to build the VAX DIL.   BUILD.COM  runs
five  command  files  which compile and build all the image and object
files required.

BUILD.COM expects to find the following logical names:  DILL:,  DIXL:,
and  DITL:.  DILL:  is the library of DIL specific sources while DIXL:
is the library of DIX specific sources, and DITL:  is the  library  of
DIT  specific sources.  You can either define the logicals to point to
your build directory, or you can modify BUILD.COM and the six  command
files  which  it uses so that they do not use these logical names.  If
you decide to modify the command files, you will have  to  modify  the
following files only:

      o  BUILD.COM
      o  COMDIX.COM
      o  COMDIT.COM

      o  COMDIL.COM
      o  DILOLB.COM
      o  DILEXE.COM
      o  INTERFILS.COM


Simply submit BUILD.COM for  batch  processing  and  wait  for  it  to
finish.   Verify  that the build completed correctly by looking at the
log file, BUILD.LOG
