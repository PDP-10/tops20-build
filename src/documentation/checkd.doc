CHECKD.DOC -- Changes from V4(30) to V5(33)
October 1981



1.0  SUMMARY

CHECKD  checks  TOPS-20  disk  file   structure   and   bittable   for
consistency.   In  the  process  of  checking the directory structure,
CHECKD finds all disk space which is in use;  this  allows  CHECKD  to
compute  the disk pages lost.  CHECKD can optionally release this lost
space.  CHECKD can  also  be  used  to  completely  rebuild  the  disk
bittable  or  to  scan  the  directory  structure for a specified disk
address.  CHECKD may also be used to create new file structures.

CHECKD provides the ability for initializing  labeled  magnetic  tapes
and for displaying label information on magnetic tapes.

CHECKD version 5(33) runs ONLY on TOPS-20 Release 5.

CHECKD is documented in the TOPS-20 Operator's Guide.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

CHECKD includes support for RP07 and BAD BLOCK file editing.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


4.1  Files Needed to Run CHECKD

CHECKD consists of one file, CHECKD.EXE.  CHECKD should  be  installed
on both SYS:  and SYSTEM:
CKD5.DOC                                                        Page 3


4.2  Instructions for Loading and Installing CHECKD

Mount the tape labeled  Installation  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     SKIP MTA0:5 FILES
     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>CHECKD.EXE (TO) SYS:*.*.-1
     REWIND
     EXIT
     COPY SYS:CHECKD.EXE SYSTEM:CHECKD.EXE



4.3  Files Needed to Build CHECKD

CHECKD is built from the following file:

     CHECKD.MAC

In addition, the following files must be in SYS:

     MACREL.REL
     MACSYM.UNV
     MONSYM.UNV
     GLXMAC.UNV
     QSRMAC.UNV


4.4  Instructions for Building CHECKD

Mount the tape labeled  Distribution  Tape  on  MTA0:   and  type  the
following commands:

     R DUMPER
     TAPE MTA0:
     REWIND
     DENSITY 1600-BPI
     SKIP 1
     RESTORE <*>*.*.* (TO) <self>*.*.*
     REWIND
     ^C
     SUBMIT CHECKD.CTL/TIME/UNIQ:0/REST
CKD5.DOC                                                        Page 4


4.5  Special Considerations

CHECKD must be run with WHEEL  or  OPERATOR  enabled,  since  it  does
physical disk accesses.  As with most privileged programs, CHECKD must
be used with caution.  Rebuilding the  bittable  under  any  condition
except  stand  alone  will  very  likely  result  in  a  mangled  file
structure.

Care shoud be taken when initializing labeled tapes, since CHECKD will
unconditionally   destroy   any  existing  data  on  a  tape  when  it
initializes it.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

CHECKD can now accomodate RP20/RP07 disk drives.

The help text for CHECKD is now embedded in the code.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

Use extreme caution.
