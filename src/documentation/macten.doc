MACTEN.DOC -- Changes from V4(45) to V5(46)
September 1985



1.0  SUMMARY

This release is a maintenance release with the copyright macro changed
to use a backslash as a delimiter instead of a period.

MACTEN.MAC is documented in the listing.



1.1  Purpose Of MACTEN.MAC

MACTEN.MAC is designed to form a consistent and convenient  definition
of macros and symbols which occur frequently in the development of any
program on the DECsystem-10.  This file excludes anything which  is  a
function  of  the  monitor  call  interface  so  it can be used by any
program including those which do not call the  monitor,  such  as  the
monitor  itself  and various bootstraps.  It is most conveniently used
in the form of the MACTEN.UNV file.  A MACTEN.REL  is  also  generated
for  those  products  which  use  it.   A  table of contents gives the
general layout of the information.  The  definition  of  a  particular
symbol can best be found from the CREF listing of MACTEN.  All symbols
are ASUPPRESSed so that unreferenced definitions are deleted.
