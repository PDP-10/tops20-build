   OPR is the operator interface.  The operator's command language allows
   you  to communicate with certain components of TOPS-20, to control the
   batch streams and the input and output devices.  You also use  OPR  to
   send messages to jobs, terminals, and batch-streams, and to respond to
   requests for  operator  action,  such  as  from  the  PLEASE  program.
   Chapter  2  contains  a thorough introduction to using OPR.  Chapter 3
   describes all OPR commands in alphabetical  order.   LCP  is  the  LAT
   Control  Program.  LAT (Local Area Transport) is a protocol to control
   communication between LAT  terminal  servers  and  LAT  hosts  on  the
   Ethernet.  Chapter 4 contains a detailed introduction to LAT functions
   that you can control with LCP, and also describes the LCP commands, in
   alphabetical order.

   ^E (Control-E) privileged commands are commands that  can  affect  the
   entire  system,  and  therefore  can be used only by those with OPR or
   WHEEL privileges enabled.  The first  character  of  each  command  is
   <CTRL/E>   (typed   in  by  pressing  the  keys  labeled  CTRL  and  E
   simultaneously), which echoes on your terminal as ^E.

   ^E privileged commands allow you  to  shut  down  the  system,  create
   accounts,  define  system-wide logical names, and send messages to all
   users simultaneously.  ^E privileged commands and their functions are:

         o  ^ECEASE - shuts down the system

         o  ^ECREATE - creates a directory

         o  ^EDEFINE - defines system-wide logical names

         o  ^EEDDT - debugs the EXEC

         o  ^EPRINT - displays directory parameters

         o  ^EQUIT - halts the EXEC

         o  ^ESEND - sends system-wide messages

         o  ^ESET - sets system-wide and local parameters

         o  ^ESPEAK - gives commands to SYSJOB

   ^E commands are described in Chapter 5 in alphabetical order.   PTYCON
   is  a program that allows you to RUN more than one job simultaneously,
   without requiring each job to have an associated timesharing terminal.
   PTYCON  runs  each  job  as  a  subjob controlled by a pseudo-terminal
   (PTY).   PTYCON  can  send  information  to  each  PTY   and   receive
   information  from  each  PTY.   Each  PTY  is  in  effect  a  software
   simulation of a timesharing terminal.

   PTYCON allows the many operator jobs, such as GALAXY, OPR, and NMLT20,
   to be run from a single terminal, under the control of the operator.

   PTYCON commands are described in  Chapter  6  in  alphabetical  order.
   Chapter 6 also contains an introduction to using PTYCON.

   2.1  INTRODUCTION TO THE OPERATOR INTERFACE   2.1  INTRODUCTION TO THE OPERATOR INTERFACE

   OPR, the Operator Interface, is both a component and the main  command
   language  used  in  the  TOPS-20  operating  system.   This  component
   provides you, the operator, with the language to communicate with  the
   following components of the TOPS-20 operating system:

        1.  QUASAR, the GALAXY Scheduler

        2.  BATCON, the Batch Controller

        3.  LPTSPL, the Line-Printer Spooler

        4.  SPRINT, the Reader Interpreter

        5.  CDRIVE, the Card-Reader Spooler

        6.  SPROUT, the Card-Punch, Paper-Tape-Punch, and Plotter Spooler

        7.  MOUNTR, the Tape-Drive and Disk-Drive Controller

        8.  NEBULA, the Cluster GALAXY Message Router

                                                                  _______   Further information on these components can be found  in  the  TOPS-20
   __________ _____   Operator's Guide.

   You also use the OPR command language to communicate with:

         o  Any program requesting operator action (such  as  the  PLEASE
            program)

         o  Any user on the system

         o  All users on a remote system in the cluster

   The component that receives the OPR commands and communicates with all
   the other operating system components is ORION.

   To start OPR, you must have WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges.   (See  your
   System  Manager  to  get  these  privileges if you do not already have
   either of them.)

   To handle all batch software tasks and all PLEASE, MOUNT, and DISMOUNT
   requests,  you  must  have  OPR  running.   Normally,  commands in the
   PTYCON.ATO file start  OPR  automatically  as  a  PTYCON  subjob.   An
   example of this command file is shown on the next page.

                                    NOTE

           It is the responsibility of  your  System  Manager  to
           determine whether OPR is to run as a subjob of PTYCON.
           In addition,  your  System  Manager  should  determine
           whether any other program or utility should be started
           as a PTYCON subjob.

   OPR is your primary  interface  with  the  operating  system  and  its
   devices.   Thus,  it  is  recommended  that if your installation has a
   hardcopy central terminal (CTY), it should be dedicated to OPR.  To do
   this,  LOGIN and ATTACH to PTYCON; the OPR> prompt then appears at the
   CTY.  In the following example, your password is FOO and your  account
   number is OPERATOR.

   If your installation has  more  than  one  terminal  assigned  to  its
   operators,  you  can run separate OPRs from different terminals.  (See
   Section 2.2.2.) Thus, OPR can run as a  subjob  under  PTYCON  at  one
   terminal  and  as  a job by itself at another terminal.  All OPRs have
   the same functionality as the OPR running as a subjob  of  PTYCON  and
   CONNECTed  to  the  CTY.   ORION,  the  OPR-controlling component, can
   handle an unlimited number of terminals running  OPR.   Multiple  OPRs
   are discussed in Section 2.2.2.

   If you want OPR as a subjob under PTYCON and the PTYCON.ATO  file  did
   not  automatically  start  OPR,  you can either CONNECT to a subjob to
   start OPR or DEFINE a subjob as OPR  and  then  CONNECT  to  it.   The
   examples below show both methods of creating an OPR subjob.

   When you issue a command to OPR,  OPR  validates  the  syntax  of  the
   command  and  generates error messages for any errors it may find.  If
   there are no errors, the command is passed to the correct  process  to
   be executed.

   If you receive an  error  message,  you  can  retype  the  entire  OPR
   command,  or  press  <CTRL/H>  to  reprint the command up to the point
   where the error occurred in the command.  (Refer to Section 2.4.2.)

   To exit from OPR at any time, simply  issue  the  command  EXIT.   You
   immediately  return  to  TOPS-20 command level and you are prompted by
   the dollar-sign ($).  For example:

            _________        OPR>EXIT<RET>
        $

   If OPR is a subjob of PTYCON, you  can  type  <CTRL/X>  to  return  to
   PTYCON command level.  For example:

            __        OPR>^X
             ^
             |
         <CTRL/X>
        PTYCON>

   In addition, you can give the PUSH command to OPR to return to TOPS-20
   command  processor  level.   Then, you can execute any program or task

   In a data networking environment, a DECSYSTEM-20 communicates with one
   or  more separate computer processors.  Each processor in a network is
   called a "node." The DECSYSTEM-20, running TOPS-20, is a "host"  node.
   The host node is the only type of node in the TOPS-20 network that can
   support interactive users on a timesharing basis.  The operator at the
   host  node  is  the system operator.  The system operator controls the
   devices connected to his host node and those connected to  the  remote
   stations that are controlled by his host node.

   In a DECnet network, two or more  hosts  may  communicate.   The  host
   operator  logs  into  his  "local"  host.   The other hosts are called
   "remote" hosts.  The host operator cannot control  devices  at  remote
   hosts.

   The processors in the TOPS-20 network,  other  than  host  nodes,  are
   known  as  remote  stations.   These  remote  stations  do not support
   interactive users, and usually have  one  card  reader  and  one  line
   printer.  Remote stations are used for remote submission of batch jobs
   to a host node.   The  operator  at  a  remote  station  is  a  remote
   operator.    The  remote  operator  can  control  only  those  devices
   connected to his remote station.  He cannot  control  devices  at  the
   host node.

   The remote station is an IBM-type node.  Your remote station operators
   should   have  additional  documentation.   The  following  manual  is
                                               ___  _____________________   available for remote  station  operators:   IBM  Emulation/Termination
   ______   Manual is useful for IBM-type remote stations.

   This  manual  helps  the  remote  station  operator  determine   those
   functions he can perform at the remote station.  The commands that the
   remote station operator uses will  work  on  his  remote  station;  no
   further specification is necessary.

   The system operator can perform any of the functions in  this  manual.
   However, no operator can control devices at a remote host node.

   The OPR program allows the operator to specify a remote  node  as  the
   destination  for  a  command.   Many  OPR commands recognize the /NODE
   switch.  The /NODE switch can specify  either  a  DECnet  or  IBM-type
   remote  station,  or it can specify the operator's host node; any node
   name may  be  specified.   However  for  remote  DECnet  nodes,  these
   commands  have no effect.  To use the /NODE switch, type the following
   in the command line:

        /NODE:node-name::

   Two colons (::) following the node name are optional.



   2.2.2  Multiple OPRs on the System   2.2.2  Multiple OPRs on the System

   You can have more than one OPR running on the same  operating  system.
   ORION   keeps   track   of   each   OPR   and  sends  the  appropriate
   acknowledgement messages to the OPR that sent the command.

   Only  the  host  system  can  have   more   than   one   OPR   running
   simultaneously.  Remote stations can only have one OPR running.  Thus,
   if you have remote stations at your  installation,  any  message  sent
   from a remote station to the host system displays at all OPR's running
   at the host.  If a message is sent to a remote station from  the  host
   (the /NODE:  switch), the message displays only at that node.

   Each OPR that is processing can be set to enable or disable the  types
   of messages to be displayed at that OPR console.  For example, one OPR
   could be responsible for only tape and disk mounts and dismounts,  and
   another  OPR  could  be responsible for everything else.  Refer to the
   detailed descriptions of the DISABLE and ENABLE commands elsewhere  in
   this manual.



   2.3  RUNNING SEMI-OPR   2.3  RUNNING SEMI-OPR

   SEMI-OPR is a new user privilege that permits a designated user to use
   a  subset  of  OPR  commands.   This  subset of OPR commands are those
   commands for accessing information  (such  as  SHOW)  and  controlling
   certain  devices  (such  as  FORWARDSPACE).   A  user may be given the
   SEMI-OPR  privilege  by  another  user  who  has  WHEEL  or   OPERATOR
   privileges.

   The System Administrator can  enable  the  SEMI-OPR  privilege  for  a
   particular  user  with the ^ECREATE command (or BUILD command) at EXEC
   command level.  For example, you can authorize user  <BROWN>  to  have
   the SEMI-OPR privilege by performing the following:


                                    2-6
                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR                        THE OPERATOR INTERFACE, OPR

          _____        $$<RET>
        $

   The System Administrator can also determine which devices  a  SEMI-OPR
   can  control  when  a  GALGEN  is performed.  The devices are printer,
   card-reader, tape drive, plotter, card punch, and paper-tape-punch.

   The operator of your system can turn on or turn  off  SEMI-OPR  system
   wide with the OPR commands ENABLE and DISABLE.  For example, to ENABLE
   SEMI-OPR:

            ______ _____________        OPR>ENABLE SEMI-OPR<RET>
        OPR>
        13:06:10       --SEMI-OPERATOR enable--
        OPR>

   To DISABLE SEMI-OPR:

            _______ _____________        OPR>DISABLE SEMI-OPR<RET>
        OPR>
        13:06:19       --SEMI-OPERATOR disable--
        OPR>

   When the user activates SEMI-OPR by typing OPR at EXEC  command  level
   followed by a carriage-return, the SEMI-OPR> prompt appears.  When the
   user types a  "?"  for  the  SEMI-OPR>  prompt,  only  those  commands
   applicable to SEMI-OPR appear.

   2.3.1  SEMI-OPR Limitations and Restrictions   2.3.1  SEMI-OPR Limitations and Restrictions

   The following limitations and restrictions should be  remembered  when
   designating and using SEMI-OPR:

         o  The user must ENABLE capabilities at EXEC  command  level  to
            run SEMI-OPR.

         o  The system must be running a Release 7 monitor and GALAXY 6.

         o  SEMI-OPR can execute only certain OPR commands.

         o  SEMI-OPR cannot run LCP and NCP (ENTER command),  or  another
            application program by way of OPR.



   2.3.2  SEMI-OPR Commands   2.3.2  SEMI-OPR Commands

   For users to utilize SEMI-OPR, they must have SEMI-OPERATOR privileges
   enabled  and SEMI-OPR must be enabled.  SEMI-OPR commands allow a user
   to access information and to have limited control over  devices.   The
   following are the permitted SEMI-OPR commands:

        ALIGN              BACKSPACE       CONTINUE        EXIT
        FORWARDSPACE       HELP            IDENTIFY        PUSH
        SHOW               SHUTDOWN        START           STOP
        SUPPRESS           TAKE            WAIT

                                    NOTE

           The above list  contains  all  the  possible  SEMI-OPR
           commands.    However,  the  System  Administrator  can
           define a subset of  the  SEMI-OPR  commands  based  on
           device  types.   Therefore, when a SEMI-OPR requests a
           list of available  commands  by  typing  a  "?",  only
           commands  enabled  by  the  System  Administrator  are
           displayed.

   For a more detailed  description  of  the  above  commands,  refer  to
   Chapter  3,  and  remember  the limitations and restrictions listed in
   Section 2.3.1.



   2.4  OPR COMMAND FEATURES   2.4  OPR COMMAND FEATURES

   The OPR command language has three command features that allow you  to
   do the following:

        1.  List available commands - ?

        2.  Use recognition - <ESC>

        3.  Reprint faulty commands - <CTRL/H>

   These features are described in detail in the  following  sections  of
   this chapter.

   If you are a remote station operator (that is,  if  your  installation


                                    2-8

   has  DECnet software), you will not have the above features.  However,
   you can obtain help with the HELP command at OPR command level.  Refer
   to Chapter 3 for a description of the HELP command.

   In  addition,  CTRL/character  commands  such  as  CTRL/R  and  CTRL/U
   function at OPR command level as they do at TOPS-20 command level.



   2.4.1  ?  (Question Mark) - Listing Available Commands   2.4.1  ?  (Question Mark) - Listing Available Commands

   You can type a question mark at command level or while in the  process
   of typing a command.

   When you type a question  mark  to  the  OPR>  prompt,  it  lists  the
   available  OPR commands.  When you type a question mark in the process
   of entering an OPR command, it lists the available  keywords  to  that
   command.   When  you type a question mark after the keyword, OPR lists
   the available values, arguments, and/or switches to that keyword.   If
   you type a question mark after an entire OPR command, OPR replies with
   the message:  "confirm with  carriage  return",  retypes  your  entire
   command, and waits for you to press the carriage return key.

                          ----- Restriction -----

   If you type a question mark after an OPR command  argument  or  switch
   and  there  are  no  additional  arguments  that  can be supplied, OPR
   responds with the message:  "confirm with carriage  return"  and  then
   retypes  your  complete  OPR  command  and  waits for you to press the
   carriage return key.  (All OPR  commands  must  end  with  a  carriage
   return;  the  ESCape,  <CTRL/H>,  and  ?   features do not require the
   carriage return.)

                            ----- Examples -----

        1.  Start OPR and, after the system prompts you with OPR>, type a
            question mark.

                    The NCP command appears in the above  example
                    when  your  installation  has DECnet software
                    and  your  system  has  been  generated   for

   2.4.2  ESCape - Using Recognition   2.4.2  ESCape - Using Recognition

   The ESCape feature allows recognition input and guide words to  appear
   on your console when you give an OPR command.

   To give the ESCape feature, you must press the key labeled  ESC,  SEL,
   PRE, or ALT depending on the type of terminal at your installation.

                                    NOTE

           All OPR commands accept  recognition  input  when  you
           press  the  ESCape  key, and most OPR commands provide
           guide words within parentheses.   However,  only  this
           section of the manual describes this ESCape feature of
           the OPR command language.

           ESCape is not available at remote  station  terminals.
           If you are at a remote station, use the HELP command.
   To use the ESCape key for recognition, type  the  first  one  or  more
   letters  of  an  OPR  command  to  make  it  unique from all other OPR
   commands, such as REQ (for the REQUEUE command), and press the  ESCape
   key.   OPR  responds  with  the  remainder of the command REQUEUE, the
   guide words within parentheses (current job  on),  and  waits  for  an
   argument for the REQUEUE command.

            <ESC>
              |
              V
            __        OPR>REQUEUE (current job on) 

   Now type the first one or more letters of a REQUEUE argument, such  as
   PR  (for  PRINTER)  and  press  the ESCape key.  OPR responds with the
   remainder of the keyword PRINTER, the guide words  within  parenthesis
   (unit  number  or remote printer type), and waits for a unit number to
   be specified.

                                <ESC>
                                  |

   Now type the unit number of the line printer followed  by  the  REASON
   switch to the REQUEUE command.  After you type the slash and the first

   The <CTRL/H> feature prints the command you issued that resulted in an
   OPR  error  message.   An OPR error message occurs when a command does
   not have the correct format, syntax, switch, or value.

   When you press <CTRL/H>  after  the  error  message  appears  on  your
   terminal,  OPR retypes your entire command up to the point you entered
   the incorrect command input.

   To use the <CTRL/H> feature, type an OPR command such as SET with  the
   argument BATCH-STREAM but misspell the word STREAM.

   2.4.4  Continuing OPR Command Lines   2.4.4  Continuing OPR Command Lines

   While you are using the OPR program, you may find it necessary to type
   a  command line that is longer than the maximum line length allowed by
   your terminal.  You may continue typing the command past  the  end  of
   the  line  and  onto the next line, without pressing RETURN.  OPR will
   accept arguments which are divided between lines.   Note  the  divided
   word, ACCESS-NAME, in this example:

            ______ ____ ________ _______________ _______ ______ ________        OPR>DEFINE NODE IBMNOD:: SNA-WORKSTATION GATEWAY IBMNAM ACCESS-N
        ___ ___________        AME ACCNAM<RET>

   If you want to avoid divided  words,  you  may  use  the  continuation
   feature.   At  the  end of the first line, type a space, then a hyphen
   (-), and press RETURN.  Then finish the command on the next line.

            ______ ____ ________ _______________ _______ ______ ______        OPR>DEFINE NODE IBMNOD:: SNA-WORKSTATION GATEWAY IBMNAM -<RET>
        ___________ ______ _____        ACCESS-NAME ACCNAM <RET>

   Note that the OPR> prompt does not appear on the  second  line,  after
   you  press  RETURN the first time.  The space and hyphen indicate that
   you wish to continue typing on the next line.

   2.5  OPR MESSAGES   2.5  OPR MESSAGES

   There are two types of messages that can appear at your OPR terminal:

        1.  ORION-to-OPR messages (Section 2.4.1)

        2.  OPR error messages (Section 2.4.2)



   2.5.1  ORION-To-OPR Messages   2.5.1  ORION-To-OPR Messages

   The types of messages from ORION to OPR that can appear  at  your  OPR
   terminal are messages about:

        1.  Errors generated when ORION accepts an OPR command, but  does
            not have the appropriate devices, streams, nodes, or jobs

        2.  Jobs that start processing within a stream or device

        3.  Jobs that end processing within a stream or device

        4.  Actions that you must perform for various  devices,  streams,
            or jobs

        5.  Information you must respond to

        6.  Results from TAKE command files

   Each OPR command that is sent to ORION is time stamped by  ORION  when
   the command is accepted and executed.  The acceptance and execution of
   the command is then returned to the OPR terminal  in  the  form  of  a
   message  with  the  time  stamp  as  the first eight characters of the
   message.  For example, the OPR command:

            ___ _______ _ __________ ___________        OPR>SET PRINTER 0 FORMS-TYPE NARROW<RET>

   returns to your terminal an ORION message in the format:

        hh:mm:ss        Printer 0  --Set Accepted--

   where hh is the hour, mm is the minutes, and ss is  the  seconds  that
   the command was accepted and executed.

   Likewise, when ORION accepts an  OPR  command  but  returns  an  error
   message,  that  message  also contains a time stamp.  For example, the
   OPR command:

        OPR>SHOW MESSAGES<RET>

   displays  the  following  information  message  when  there   are   no
   outstanding messages to respond to:


                                    2-15

        hh:mm:ss        --No Outstanding Messages--

   When a particular job starts to process within a batch stream or on  a
   device,  ORION  displays  a message at your OPR terminal to notify you
   that the stream or device is active.  For example:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  --Begin--
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA

        OPR>

   appears on your terminal when a job named TEST begins  to  process  in
   batch  stream  0 for user ZINA.  The hh:mm:ss at the beginning of this
   message is the time that the job started to process  (hours,  minutes,
   seconds).

   Likewise, when a particular job ends its  processing  within  a  batch
   stream  or  on a device, ORION displays a message at your OPR terminal
   to notify you that the stream or device is not active and the job  has
   completed.  For example:

        hh:mm:ss        Batch-stream 0  --End--
                        Job TEST Req #274 for ZINA
        OPR>

   appears on your terminal when a job named TEST  ends  the  process  in
   batch  stream  0 for user ZINA.  The hh:mm:ss at the beginning of this
   message is the time that the job ended the  process  (hours,  minutes,
   seconds).



   2.5.2  OPR Error Messages   2.5.2  OPR Error Messages

   In the course of using  OPR  to  enter  commands,  you  will  probably
   encounter  some  error  messages.  All OPR error messages begin with a
   question mark.  Error messages can  not  be  abbreviated  with  system
   switches  or  parameters as in some system programs.  In addition, the
   question mark does not represent a fatal error in OPR as  it  does  in
   some other system programs.

   When you receive an error message, you can  press  CTRL/H  (to  retype
   your  OPR  command  up  to  the  point where you entered the incorrect
   keyword, switch, or value) and then specify the correct input  to  the
   command.   As  with  all  OPR commands, if you do not know the command
   format or you have forgotten the keywords, switches, or values, type a
   question  mark  and  OPR  lists  the  command  arguments  that you can
   specify.

   Each error message described below and on the following pages explains
   the error message and a possible solution.

                  ?  Ambiguous:   ERROR:         ?  Ambiguous:

   Reason:        You abbreviated a keyword  or  switch  but  it  is  not
                  unique;  one  or  more  other keywords or switches also
                  have the same abbreviation.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype the command and  include  enough
                  letters   of   the   keyword  or  switch  to  make  the
                  abbreviation unique.


                  ?  Does not match switch or keyword:  "argument"   ERROR:         ?  Does not match switch or keyword:  "argument"

   Reason:        You have specified a  switch  or  keyword  for  an  OPR
                  command  that  does  not  take  the  switch  or keyword
                  specified.  The invalid switch or keyword is  displayed
                  in quotes.

                  ?  File not found "file"   ERROR:         ?  File not found "file"

   Reason:        You have specified an OPR command  that  takes  a  file
                  specification  as  a  keyword  or switch value, but the
                  file was not found.

                  "character"                  "character"

   Reason:        You have specified a keyword or switch value that  must
                  be numeric, but the first character is an alphabetic or
                  is a special character.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H  or  retype  the  command  and  specify  a
                  numeric  keyword  or  switch  value with any alphabetic
                  character.

                  of the device name.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  device name with the correct characters and include the
                  colon.


                  ?  Invalid guide word   ERROR:         ?  Invalid guide word

   Reason:        You have specified a guide word that does  not  pertain
                  to   the   OPR  command  that  you  specified,  or  you
                  misspelled the guide word, or you used recognition (you
                  pressed  the  ESCape  key)  and  then  pressed <CTRL/W>
                  before you pressed the carriage return.

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype the command.  If you  must  have
                  guide  words with the OPR command, use recognition with
                  the ESCape key.


                  ?  Invalid node name   ERROR:         ?  Invalid node name

   Recovery:      Press CTRL/H or retype  the  command  and  specify  the
                  correct node name or number to the /NODE:  switch.  You
                  might have to ENABLE the node before  you  reissue  the

        BATCH-STREAM       specifies a particular batch stream that has a
                           job  currently  active  within  it.   A  batch
                           stream is  a  pseudo-terminal  that  interacts
                           with the system to execute a batch job.

        CARD-PUNCH         specifies a particular card-punch device  that
                           has a job currently being output on it.

        PAPER-TAPE-PUNCH   specifies a particular paper-tape-punch device
                           that has a job currently being output on it.

        PLOTTER            specifies a particular plotter device that has
                           a job currently being output on it.

        PRINTER argument   specifies a particular line printer device  or
|                          a  range of line printer devices.  You can use

|                          command  to  reference a printer specification
|                          in this command.  The argument can be:

|            nn            specifies the unit number of the line printer.
|                          You must specify this unit number; there is no
|                          default.

             CLUSTER nn    specifies a printer, or a range of printers,
                     n:m   on a remote node within a TOPS-20 cluster.   A
                           TOPS-20   cluster   is   a   loosely   coupled
                           configuration of between two and four  TOPS-20
                           processors.     Each    processor    in    the
                           configuration is identified by  a  node  name.
                           For example, HUEY::, DEWEY::, and LOUIE::  can
                           be three nodes within  a  cluster  of  TOPS-20
                           processors.

                  NODE node-name::

                           specifies  that  the  printer  device  for   a
                           cluster  be  started.   The  double colon (::)
                           following the node name is not needed.

                           For the  CLUSTER  argument,  NODE  node-name::
                           specifies a node within the cluster and cannot
                           be the local node or an alias.

                           allowing  users to queue print requests to VMS
                           systems using DECnet.  DQS  accepts  the  user
                           specified  print  request  and transmits it to
                           the  remote   VMS   node.    The   "queuename"
                           specifies  the  VMS  queuename  and  can  be a
                           string of 1 to 31  characters,  consisting  of
                           alphanumeric   characters,   underscores,  and
                           dollar signs.

                  NODE node-name::

                           specifies the VMS node where the print request
                           is processed.  The double colon (::) following
                           the node name is not needed.

                           For  the  DQS   argument,   NODE   node-name::
                           specifies  the  VMS  nodename and cannot be an
                           alias.

             LAT           specifies the  Local  Area  Transport  service
                           used  to  control  communication  between  LAT
                           hosts and terminals on the Ethernet.  With the
                           LAT  keyword,  you specify the SERVICE or PORT
                           and its SERVER name to establish communication
                           between your system, running LAT software, and
                           the resource printer terminal.

        When you use the READER keyword, the only switches available  are
        the  /NODE:   and  /REASON:   switches.  This is because a reader
        input job does not become a request until  the  last  card  ($EOJ

   Function   Function

        The ALIGN command prints a "forms-alignment"  file  on  the  line
        printer so that you can align the paper.

        At various times, you may have  to  align  special  forms  for  a
        particular  line printer job, such as payroll checks or invoices.
        The ALIGN command allows you, at these times, to adjust the forms
        and  the  line printer, if need be, as many times as necessary to
        print the job correctly.

        The BACKSPACE  command  reprints  pages  in  the  file  currently
        printing on the line printer.

        At various times, you may have to  backspace  a  particular  file
        that  is currently being printed on the line printer, for example
        when the forms become jammed  in  the  printing  mechanism.   The
        BACKSPACE  command allows you to backspace the print file so that
        the pages of the file that were jammed  or  miscorrectly  printed
        can be repeated.

   Switches   Switches

        You must specify one of the following switches:

        /COPIES:nnnn       specifies the number of additional  copies  to
                           be  printed.   The number you specify is added
                           to the number of copies that the  user  queued
                           with  the  PRINT  command.   For example, if a
                           user issues the command:

                                PRINT FOO.BAR/COPIES:25

                           and  you  issue  the  BACKSPACE  command  with
                           /COPIES:10  while  FOO.BAR  is printing on the
                           line  printer,  the  total  number  of  copies
                           printed will be 35.

        /FILE              specifies that one file be backspaced  when  a
                           multifile  PRINT  request  has been given by a
                           user.  For  example,  if  a  user  issues  the
                           command:

                                PRINT FOO1.BAR,FOO2.BAR,FOO3.BAR

                           and you issue the BACKSPACE command with /FILE
                           while   FOO3.BAR   is  printing  on  the  line
                           printer, FOO2.BAR will be printed again.

        /PAGES:nnnn        specifies the number of pages to be backspaced
                           for  the file that is currently being printed.
                           The /PAGES:  switch  is  the  default  of  the
                           BACKSPACE  command.   If  you  do  not specify
                           either the /COPIES:  or the /FILE switch, then
                           you  must  specify  the  /PAGES:  switch.  The
                           number  (nnnn)  you  specify  refers  to   the
                           physical number of pages and not to the number
                           of pages that contains the file on disk.

|       Followed optionally by the switch:
|  
|       /CLUSTER-NODE:cluster-node-name
|  
|                          specifies the particular cluster  node  within
|                          the  TOPS-20  cluster  where  the  command  is
|                          processed.  The "cluster-node-name"  qualifier
|                          can  be any node name within the cluster or an
|                          asterisk  (*).   The  asterisk  specifies  all
|                          nodes within the cluster.

        When you give a BACKSPACE PRINTER command, the system prints  the
        output  in  the  printer  buffer  (which  may  contain on or more
        printed  pages)  before  BACKSPACing  the  number  of  pages  you
        specify.  Therefore, when you use the /PAGES:  switch, you should
        add two or three pages to the total number of pages you  wish  to
        BACKSPACE.

   Function   Function

        The  CANCEL  command  cancels  any  job  request  that  is  being
        processed or is waiting to be processed.  In addition, the CANCEL
        command can be used to cancel any user's request for  a  tape  or
        structure mount.

        When a user submits a request for a job  to  be  processed  or  a
        request  to  mount  a  tape  or  structure,  the system assigns a
        request number to the request.  To display the  requests  at  any
        time,  give  the  OPR  command SHOW QUEUES.  The requests will be
        displayed with the request numbers and the names of the users who
        submitted the jobs.  You cancel requests by specifying either the
        request number or the user name.  Optionally, you can cancel  all
        requests for a particular device or those of a particular type on
        the specified device.

   Function   Function

        The CLOSE command closes the current ORION log  buffer  file  and
        creates a new log buffer file.  The closed log file is written to
        disk so that you can copy or print an up-to-date file.

        The ORION log buffer file records all OPR-to-ORION  commands  and
        transactions performed at the operator's console.  When the CLOSE
        command  is  issued,  these   commands   and   transactions   are
        transferred  to  the ORION-SYSTEM.LOG file and the buffer file is
        cleared.  You can then print the  ORION-SYSTEM.LOG  file  on  the
        line printer to obtain a hard-copy of all the operating processes
        for a given time period.

        You may choose a name other than ORION-SYSTEM.LOG for  the  ORION
        log  buffer  file at GALGEN time.  Please see your System Manager
        in reference to GALGEN.

                           this  chapter.   To stop the logging facility,
                           you must give  the  DISABLE  LOGGING  command.

             CLUSTER nn    specifies a printer, or a range of printers,
                     n:m   on a remote node within a TOPS-20 cluster.   A
                           TOPS-20   cluster   is   a   loosely   coupled
                           configuration of between two and four  TOPS-20
                           processors.     Each    processor    in    the
                           configuration is identified by  a  node  name.
                           For example, HUEY::, DEWEY::, and LOUIE::  can
                           be three nodes within  a  cluster  of  TOPS-20

                           disabled.   AVR  allows  you  to mount labeled
                           tapes without the need to IDENTIFY  the  tapes
                           to  the  system  with  a keyin.  When this AVR
                           feature is disabled, you  must  IDENTIFY  each
                           labeled  tape you mount.  Unlabeled tapes must
                           always be identified to the  system  with  the
                           IDENTIFY  command.   (Refer to the description
                           of the IDENTIFY command.)

        CLASS-SCHEDULER    specifies a system program  be  disabled  that
                           allocates  portions  (or  percentages)  of the
                           central processor  unit  (CPU)  to  individual
                           groups  of  users.   These  groups  are called
                           classes and are set up by your System  Manager
                           in  the n-CONFIG.CMD file at system generation
                           time.  When the CLASS-SCHEDULER  is  disabled,
                           all  jobs  entered  into the system receive an
                           equal amount of CPU time; allocation is  on  a

                           archival or a migration, the job does not wait
                           until  the request has been satisfied.  (Refer
                           to  the  TOPS-20  Operator's   Guide   for   a
                           discussion  of  archived  and migrated files.)
                           Instead, the user receives  an  error  message
                           indicating  that  the file cannot be retrieved
                           and the batch job ends in an error  (if  error

        The DISMOUNT command  allows  you  to  dismount  (and  remove)  a
        structure  currently  mounted  on a disk drive or a magnetic tape
        currently mounted on a tape drive.

        You can dismount a structure without removing the structure  from
        the  disk drive.  The structure is then dismounted from the local
        system and users on the system are prevented  from  mounting  the
        structure from the EXEC.

        You can also dismount a structure and remove the  structure  from
        the  disk  drive.   When  the  DISMOUNT  WITH  REMOVAL command is
        issued, the structure is queued for removal.  If other  local  or
        remote  users  have  mounted the structure, a message asks you if
        you want to proceed.  If you answer NO, the request is  canceled.
        If  you answer YES, the structure is dismounted from every system
        in the cluster, and you are asked to remove it.

        When you issue the DISMOUNT command for a tape  drive,  the  tape
        rewinds  itself completely from the take-up wheel, providing that
        no user is currently using the tape.  If a user is using the tape
        on  the  specified  tape  drive,  OPR  will  reject  the DISMOUNT
        command.

        structure-name:    specifies the logical name of the structure to

                           included with the  structure  name  specified.
                           An  example  of  a  logical name is DSKC:  for
                           Disk C.

        REMOVAL            specifies that the system giving the  DISMOUNT
                           command  is  to  have exclusive control of the
                           structure.  The system checks for use  of  the
                           structure  by  users  on another system within
                           the  cluster.   If  users  on  another  system
                           within the cluster have mounted the structure,
                           a message asks you whether or not  to  proceed
                           with   the   dismount.   If  the  response  is
                           PROCEED, then the structure  is  automatically
                           dismounted  with NO REMOVAL from all the other
                           systems  within  the  cluster,  and  then  the
                           structure  is  dismounted  for  removal on the
                           local system.

                           If the structure is  not  in  use  by  another
                           system,  the  structure  is dismounted and you
                           are asked to remove it.

                           On  a  non-cluster  system,  REMOVAL  is   the
                           default to the STRUCTURE keyword.

        NO-REMOVAL         dismounts the structure without  checking  for
                           use  of  the structure by users on another CFS
                           system and prints a message telling you not to
                           physically remove the structure.

                           On a CFS system, NO-REMOVAL is  the  STRUCTURE
                           keyword default.

        If there are other users who have mounted the structure  and  you
        really  wish  to remove the structure, it is recommended that you
        send a message to all users of the system before you respond with
        YES,  to  allow  all  users  to  complete  their  tasks  on  that
        structure.

        A structure can be  DISMOUNTed  only  if  set  ACKNOWLEDGED;  you
        cannot DISMOUNT a structure that is set IGNORED.

                           tapes without the need to identify  each  tape
                           to   the   system   with  a  keyin.   However,
                           unlabeled tapes must always be  identified  to
                           the  system with the IDENTIFY command.  (Refer
                           to the description of the IDENTIFY command.)

|                          allows  ORION  messages generated on the local
|                          node to be sent to one or more  remote  nodes.
|                          It  also  allows  selective  sending  of these
|                          messages.  For example, if the local  node  is
|                          generating an excessive amount of BUGCHKS, you
|                          may want to send all messages except BUGCHKs.

        CLASS-SCHEDULER    specifies a system  program  be  enabled  that

                           groups  of  users.   These  groups  are called
                           classes and are set up by your System  Manager
                           in  the n-CONFIG.CMD file at system generation

                           cluster.  The remote systems must  be  running

        LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS

                           specifies to direct the printing of batch  log
                           files  and  spooled  files  to  specific local
                           printers.  Normally, printing of spooled files
                           (batch  or  otherwise)  is  scheduled  for the
                           first   available   local    printer.     With
                           LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS enabled, you can
                           specify  the  printer  with  the  OPR  command
                           ENABLE  PRINT-LOGFILES  n.   In this way, only
                           the local printer(s) specified print batch log
                           or spooled files.  To check if this keyword is
                           enabled, use the OPR  command  SHOW  PARAMETER
                           PRINTER.

                           If LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS  is  directed
                           to  specific  printers  (ENABLE PRINT-LOGFILES
                           n), and you  issue  the  OPR  command  DISABLE
                           LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS,   the   ENABLEd
                           printer(s) are remembered by OPR.   Therefore,
                           if  LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS  is  ENABLEd
                           later during system operation, you do not have
                           to re-issue ENABLE PRINT-LOGFILES command(s).

                           operating  system and stores these messages in
                           a log file buffer).   When  this  facility  is
                           enabled,   there   are  records  kept  of  the

                           the system.

        OUTPUT-DISPLAY     specifies  that  the  display   of   specified
                           message  groupings on your console be enabled.
                           The  groupings  are  specified  as  the  valid
                           arguments and switches to this keyword.

|                          cluster  are   displayed   on   the   operator
|                          terminal.   You  can specify the local node or
|                          an asterisk (*).  The asterisk  specifies  all
|                          nodes within the cluster.

        PRINT-LOGFILES n   specifies the local printer "n" to print batch
                           log  files and spooled files.  The OPR command
                           ENABLE   LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS    must
                           precede        this        command.         If
                           LOGFILES-TO-SPECIFIC-PRINTERS   is    reverted
                           (DISABLEd)  and  then  ENABLEd at a later time
                           during system  operation,  OPR  remembers  the
                           printer  as  ENABLEd,  thus you do not have to
                           re-issue the ENABLE PRINT-LOGFILES command.

        QUEUE-REQUESTS     specifies that all users be  enabled  to  make
                           any  queue  request.   When queue requests are
                           enabled, a user can submit a batch  or  reader
                           job,  a card-punch, paper-tape-punch, plotter,
                           or a printer request to the system.

        REPORT-CONNECTION-FAILURES

                           specifies that  NEBULA  is  to  report  DECnet
                           connection  attempt failures to remote NEBULAs
                           in the cluster on your terminal.

        SEMI-OPR           specifies to allow  users  with  SEMI-OPERATOR
                           privilege  to  have limited control of certain
                           output  devices   and   to   access   operator

        The  following  switches  can  be  used  as  arguments   of   the
        CLASS-SCHEDULER keyword:

        /CLASS-ASSIGNMENTS:

                           specifies that users of the system  have  been
                           divided into classes and have been allocated a
                           certain amount of CPU time.  The two arguments
                           available  with  this  switch are ACCOUNTS and
                           POLICY-PROGRAM.

           ACCOUNTS        specifies that class assignments are  assigned
                           by  the  accounts  set  up in the n-CONFIG.CMD
                           file and the ACCOUNTS-TABLE.BIN file.

           POLICY-PROGRAM  specifies that your System Manager  or  System

                           for your installation.

        /WINDFALL:         specifies what happens  with  the  unused  CPU
                           time.   You  can  specify  either ALLOCATED or
                           WITHHELD.

           ALLOCATED       specifies that  excess  CPU  time  is  awarded
                           proportionately  to  the active classes (users
                           currently requesting CPU time).

           WITHHELD        specifies that excess  CPU  time  is  withheld
                           from all users and becomes idle time.

        You can specify the following switches  with  all  OUTPUT-DISPLAY
        arguments  except  BUGCHK-, BUGINF-, DECNET-, or SYSTEM-MESSAGES.
        If  you  do  not  specify  one  of   these   switches   with   an
        OUTPUT-DISPLAY argument, all three are assumed by default.

        /INFORMATION-MESSAGES

                           specifies that messages be displayed that  are
                           informational,  such  as errors that occur due
                           to  an  application  problem.   Also,  one-way

                           information messages, since no  response  from
                           you is necessary.

        /JOB-MESSAGES      specifies  that  messages  be  displayed  that
                           notify  you  when a device or stream has begun
                           to process a job  request  and  when  the  job
                           request has ended its processing.

        /OPR-ACTION-MESSAGES

                           specifies  that  messages  be  displayed  that

                           requested by a user or a processing job.  Also
                           included  are  messages that require action to
                           be taken, but are not  job  or  WTOR  related.
                           All  operator action messages must be answered
                           with the RESPOND command.

        You can specify the following switch with the  DECNET-CONNECTION-
        ATTEMPTS and REPORT-CONNECTION-FAILURES keywords:

        /NODE:node-name::  specifies the name of a  remote  node  in  the
                           cluster.   The double colon (::) following the
                           node name is optional.

        The EXIT command exits OPR command level and returns  to  TOPS-20
        command level.

        You can return to OPR command level  with  the  TOPS-20  CONTINUE
        command,  providing  that  you do not alter memory.  Refer to the

        Because OPR takes time to respond  to  some  commands,  the  EXIT
        command may prevent you from seeing output from previously issued

        not be interrupted when you EXIT from OPR.

        The FORWARDSPACE command  spaces  the  print  file  on  the  line
        printer in a forward direction, so that you can skip the printing
        of a job, file, or page(s).  The FORWARDSPACE command allows  you
        to  forwardspace  the  print  file so that you can save paper and
        print only what is needed as output.

        At various times, you may have to forwardspace a particular  file
        that  is currently being printed on the line printer, for example
        when a user requires only a portion of some printed output.

|                          processed.  The "cluster-node-name"  qualifier
|                          can  be any node name within the cluster or an
|                          asterisk  (*).   The  asterisk  specifies  all
|                          nodes within the cluster.

        /COPIES:nnnn       specifies the number of copies to  be  skipped
                           from  printing.   The  number  you  specify is
                           subtracted from the  number  that  was  queued
                           with  the  PRINT  command.   For example, if a
                           user issued the command

                           PRINT FOO.BAR/COPIES:25

                           and you issue the  FORWARDSPACE  command  with
                           /COPIES:10  while  FOO.BAR  is printing on the
                           line  printer,  the  total  number  of  copies
                           printed will be 15.

        /FILE              specifies that you forward space one file when
                           a  multifile PRINT request has been given by a
                           user.  For  example,  if  a  user  issues  the
                           command

                           PRINT FOO1.BAR,FOO2.BAR,FOO3.BAR

                           and you issue the  FORWARDSPACE  command  with
                           /FILE  while  FOO1.BAR is printing on the line
                           printer, FOO2.BAR starts printing on the  line

   Restrictions   Restrictions

        When you give the FORWARDSPACE PRINTER command, the system prints
        the  output  in the printer buffer (which may contain one or more
        printed pages) before FORWARDSPACing  the  number  of  pages  you
        specify.   Therefore,  when  you  use  the  /PAGES:nn switch, you
        should subtract two or three pages from the total number of pages
        you wish to FORWARDSPACE.

   Function   Function

        The IDENTIFY command services tape mount requests by enabling you
        to:

         o  Satisfy a user's mount request for an unlabeled tape.

         o  Satisfy a user's request for a labeled tape that  is  mounted
            on a drive that has AVR disabled.

         o  Pre-place and identify an unlabeled tape.

        When a user issues a mount request for  an  unlabeled  tape,  you
        must physically locate, mount, and ready the requested tape on an
        available tape drive and then 'IDENTIFY' the  tape-mount  request
        to the tape drive.

        When more than one user issues a  mount  request  for  a  scratch
        tape,  the  IDENTIFY SCRATCH command applies to the first request
        received.  If you need to service a request other than the first,
        use the IDENTIFY REQUEST-ID command.

        If you have AVR enabled and your installation uses labeled tapes,
        you  do not need to give the IDENTIFY command after you mount and
        ready a tape on a tape drive.

   Function   Function

        The MODIFY command changes the priority of a job request  waiting
        in  a queue for processing.  The higher the priority number is in
        the MODIFY  command,  the  greater  the  importance  of  the  job
        request.

        When any job request is submitted for processing by a  user,  its
        priority  number  defaults to a value that is set at GALGEN time.
        The user who requests the job can set the priority value with the
        /PRIORITY:   switch.   However, the MODIFY command permits you to
        change the priority value for any job request.

   Function   Function

        The MOUNT command mounts a structure and allows users  to  access
        it.  Give the MOUNT command after physically mounting a structure
        or after a physically mounted structure has been  DISMOUNTed  but
        not  removed  from the disk drive.  The MOUNT command also allows
        you  to  assign  the  structure  an  alias  name  when  two  file
        structures have the same name.

        Unlike the EXEC MOUNT command, the OPR  MOUNT  command  does  not
        place  a  mount  request  in the mount queue or identify you as a
        user of the structure.  If the structure is physically mounted in
        the  drive,  the  MOUNT  command is executed immediately.  If the
        structure is not mounted  in  the  drive,  you  receive  a  MOUNT
        request.   The  MOUNT command is then executed automatically when
        the structure is physically mounted.

        The structure is MOUNTed only when it is physically mounted in  a
        disk drive and has AVAILABLE and ACKNOWLEDGED attributes.

             CLUSTER nn    specifies a printer on a remote node within  a
                           TOPS-20  cluster.   A  TOPS-20  cluster  is  a
                           loosely coupled configuration of  between  two
                           and  four  TOPS-20 processors.  Each processor
                           in the configuration is identified by  a  node
                           name.    For  example,  HUEY::,  DEWEY::,  and
                           LOUIE::  can be three nodes within  a  cluster
                           of TOPS-20 processors.

        The NEXT command ignores  most  attributes  of  a  request.   For
        example,  if  a print request has the attribute /UNIT:0, the NEXT
        command can print the request on a different printer.

        You should attempt to honor request attributes when possible.


   Example   Example

        A user has requested that his job be printed as soon as possible.

        The PUSH command leaves  OPR  command  level  and  enters  a  new
        operating  system (EXEC) command level.  You can then perform any
        software task or run any utility.  To return to OPR, type the POP

        further information on the POP command.)

                                      NOTE

                Do not run OPR at the  new  EXEC  command  level.
                Return to OPR by using the TOPS-20 POP command.

        You can use the PUSH command to create a lower copy of an EXEC of
        your  choice.   Normally,  PUSH  creates  the EXEC defined by the
        system logical  name,  DEFAULT-EXEC:.   Use  the  TOPS-20  DEFINE
        command  to  define the job-wide logical name DEFAULT-EXEC:, with
        the filespec for the EXEC you want to use each time you PUSH.

        The REQUEUE PRINTER  command  immediately  stops  sending  a  job
        request  to  the printer.  However, the printer finishes printing
        the data already in its buffer.  Therefore,  when  you  give  the
        REQUEUE  PRINTER command, the printer may continue to print a few
        more pages of a job request before it  stops  or  prints  another
        request.

   RESPOND - Responding to Messages   RESPOND - Responding to Messages



   Function   Function

        The RESPOND command to replies to any message  sent  to  you  via
        WTOR  (Write  To  Operator  with  Response) from a user or from a
        software task.

        When a user or software task sends you a message that requires  a
        response,  OPR  assigns the message a number so that you can keep
        track of all messages sent to operations.  With the  use  of  the
        SHOW  MESSAGES command, you can find out at any time if there are
        any outstanding messages.

        There are no keywords or switches for the  RESPOND  command,  but
        you  must  specify the message number.  Also, you may be required
        to include a message; therefore you may specify a message in  the
        RESPOND command.

        nnn                specifies the message number of a message that
                           was  sent  to  you via WTOR (Write To Operator
                           with Response).

        text               specifies a single- or multiple-line response,
                           which  you  terminate  with a carriage return.
                           If you press carriage return immediately after
                           the  message  number,  OPR responds with ENTER
                           TEXT AND TERMINATE  WITH  ^Z.   You  can  then
                           enter as many lines of text as needed.  To end

   ROUTE - Routing Output Between Nodes   ROUTE - Routing Output Between Nodes



   Function   Function

        The ROUTE command changes the destination of output requests,  so
        that  the  output  intended for a specific unit (the source unit)
        will automatically be output on  another  unit  (the  destination
        unit).  The source and destination units may be on the same node,
        or they may be on different nodes.

        This function is useful when a unit malfunctions and  the  output
        from that device is immediately necessary.

        If you are an operator at a central site, you  can  route  output
        from  one  unit  to  another,  on  the  same  or  any other node.
        However, output cannot be processed on another host  system.   If
        output is routed to another host node, the request(s) will remain
        in  the  queue  indefinitely,  because  the  request  cannot   be
        processed.   If  you  are  an  operator at a remote node, you can
        route requests from one unit to another on your node.

        All device routing is entered into the system route table,  which
        can be examined using the OPR command SHOW ROUTE-TABLE, described
        in this chapter.  The  ROUTE  command  also  allows  you  to  end
        routing  and  delete  the  entry  from the system route table, by
        omitting the information pertaining to  the  destination  unit(s)
        and node.

                           actions that a user or batch job requests.

        PRIORITY-LIMITS nn specifies  the  priority  limits  of  a  batch
                           stream  or  a  range  of  batch streams at the
                           central site or at a node.  The numeric  value
                           associated  with this argument means that only
                           batch  jobs  submitted  by  users   with   the
                           /PRIORITY:   switch  specifying the number (or
                           range)  you  set  for  the  batch  stream  can
                           execute in that stream.  The numeric value for
                           the PRIORITY-LIMITS argument can be from 1  to
                           63.   The  higher  the  number, the higher the
                           priority.

        TIME-LIMITS nn     specifies the maximum execution time limit for
                           a  given  batch  stream  or  a  range of batch
                           streams.  When a  batch  job  enters  a  batch
                           stream,  it receives a default execution time,
                           such as five minutes.  If the job exceeds this
                           time  limit  and if the user who submitted the
                           batch job set up his control  file  to  handle
                           time limits, the batch system gives the job an
                           additional 10% of the allocated time.  If  the
                           job  exceeds  this  additional 10%, the job is
                           canceled.  The TIME-LIMITS argument allows you
                           to specify that batch jobs that are set to run
                           a certain length  of  time  will  run  in  the
                           specified batch-stream number (or range).  The
                           numeric value for the TIME-LIMITS argument can
                           be from 0 to 99999, representing minutes.

   These arguments for the SET NODE command correspond to parameters  set
   by  the IBM host's system manager.  The SET NODE command gives you the
   option of changing or adding to information associated with the access
   name  you  specified  in  the  DEFINE  command.  If you specify a null
   argument for any parameter, the parameter is automatically cleared and
   reset to the information specified in the access name.

   To use the APPLICATION parameter, you must know the name  of  the  IBM
   application  to  which  you  want to connect.  Contact your IBM system
   manager for this information.

        The SET ONLINE command sets the devices listed below on-line when
        the  device  has  been  newly  installed at your operations site.
        This command is valid only  if  your  site  has  a  DX20  channel
        controller installed and on-line.

        The devices that are interfaced through the DX20 are:

        1.  TX01 - tape controller

        2.  TX03 - channel selector

        3.  TX05 - tape drive selector

        4.  TU70 - tape drive

        5.  TU71 - tape drive

        6.  TU72 - tape drive

        In addition, this command is helpful when Field Service takes one
        of  these devices off-line for repair and then returns the device
        back to you for your control.

        The SET ONLINE command's arguments  are  channel  number,  device
        unit  number, and controller number, separated by commas.  If the
        device has no controller number, type -1.

        n:m                specifies a range of paper-tape punches.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name of the type  of  paper-tape
                           forms.   Typically  in some installations, the
                           normal paper-tape form is  referred  to  as  a
                           1-inch  wide  fan-fold, and can be abbreviated
                           as 1WFF or NORMAL.  Your installation can have

                           paper-tape punch.

        LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

                           specifies what action, if any, should be taken
                           if a paper-tape job that is currently punching
                           on the unit number you specify exceeds the set

                           LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION argument.  They are:

             ASK           specifies that you are asked what to do if the
                           paper-tape  job  exceeds  the  fold  limit  on
                           output.  You then have the option to  continue
                           or abort the paper-tape job.

             CANCEL        specifies   that   the   paper-tape   job   is
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             IGNORE        specifies that the  paper-tape  job  continues
                           automatically  and  the  specified output fold
                           limit will be ignored.

        OUTPUT-LIMITS folds

                           specifies the maximum fold limit  for  punched
                           paper-tape  output.   This  argument  can also
                           specify a range  of  fold  limits.   The  fold
                           limit  refers  to  the  number of output folds
                           that are punched.  This command restricts  the
                           size  of  jobs that are sent to the paper-tape

        The SET PLOTTER command specifies what kind of jobs are scheduled
        on  this device.  You can set the forms type, output limits (step
        limits), priority limits, and the action to be taken when  a  job
        exceeds  the  output limit that you specify.  This command allows
        you change the parameters that are set at GALGEN time.   You  can
        specify a specific unit number or a range of unit numbers.

        The   plotter   device   draws   (or   plots)   ink   plots    of
        computer-generated data.  Its movement in producing the output is
        measured in "steps".  The steps refer to the speed per second  of
        the  plotter  and the distance (or size) that the pencils move on
        the output paper.  The paper for the plotter is either drum  feed
        or bed feed.

        The defaults for the plotter are set by your  System  Manager  at
        software-installation   time   through   the  generation  of  the
        <SYSTEM>SPFORM.INI file.   At  some  installations,  the  default
        settings for the plotter are referred to as NORMAL.

        nn                 specifies a plotter unit number.   The  number
                           is  usually  from 0 to 5, but can be larger if
                           your installation has more plotter devices.

        n:m                specifies a range of plotter unit numbers.

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name  of  the  type  of  plotter
                           forms.   Typically,  the  normal plotter paper
                           form is referred to as roll feed or bed  feed.
                           This can be referred to as type ROLL, DRUM, or
                           BED.  Your  installation  can  have  different
                           form names for different plotter types.

        LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

                           specifies what action, if any, should be taken
                           if a plotter job that is currently plotting on
                           the unit number you specify  exceeds  the  set
                           limit  of  output.   The limit is set with the
                           OUTPUT-LIMITS  argument.   There   are   three
                           possible    words    associated    with    the
                           LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION argument.  They are:

             ASK           specifies that you are asked what to do if the
                           plotter  job exceeds the step limit on output.
                           You then have the option to continue or  abort
                           the plotter job.

             CANCEL        specifies   that   the    plotter    job    is
                           automatically canceled when the limit has been
                           exceeded.

             IGNORE        specifies  that  the  plotter  job   continues
                           automatically  and the specified output (step)
                           limit will be ignored.

        OUTPUT-LIMIT steps

                           specifies the  number  of  plotter  steps  per
                           second.  A step is the horizontal and vertical
                           movement of the pen within  the  grid  on  the
                           paper.   This  is  referred to as the size (or
                           distance).  The number you specify  represents
                           nnK   steps   (K   =   1000).    For  example,
                           OUTPUT-LIMIT 3 is equal to 3000.

        The SET PRINTER command specifies what kind of jobs are scheduled
        on  this  device.   You  can  set  the  forms  type, page limits,
        priority limits, and the action to be taken when  a  job  exceeds
        the  output  limit  that you specify.  This command allows you to
        change the parameters that are  set  at  GALGEN  time.   You  can
        specify  a  specific  unit number or a range of unit numbers.  In
        addition, you can  specify  ranges  for  the  page  and  priority
        limits.

|       You can use an alias name defined with the DEFINE  ALIAS  command

        The defaults for the line printers at your installation  are  set
        by  your System Manager at software-installation time through the
        generation of the  <SYSTEM>n-CONFIG.CMD  file  (where  n  is  the
        TOPS-20  software  generation  number) and the <SYSTEM>LPFORM.INI
        file.  These defaults are usually referred to as NORMAL  in  most
        installations.

        The printer is also commonly referred to as the line printer.

        There are two basic types of line printers, those that  print  in
        uppercase  characters  only  (64  character print drum) and those
        that  print  in  both  uppercase  and  lowercase  characters  (96
        character print drum).

        FORMS-TYPE name    specifies the name  of  the  type  of  printer
                           forms.   Typically,  the normal paper form for
                           the printer is referred to  as  1-ply-wide  or
                           1-ply-narrow.   These can be abbreviated as 1W
                           or 1N, or can be given some other name by your
                           System  Manager.   Your  installation can have
                           different names for different  types  of  line
                           printer forms.  By setting the FORMS-TYPE, you
                           are specifying the type of forms in  the  line
                           printer.   The  FORMS-TYPE  argument  is valid
                           with the unit  number  argument  and  the  LAT
                           (PORT   or   SERVICE)  arguments.   FORMS-TYPE

        LIMIT-EXCEEDED-ACTION word

                           specifies what action, if any, should be taken
                           if a printer job that is currently printing on
                           the  unit  number  you  specify  exceeds   the
                           specified  limit  of output.  The limit is set
                           with  the  PAGE-LIMITS  argument.   There  are
                           three   possible  words  associated  with  the

        The SET SCHEDULER  command  changes  the  scheduling  scheme  (or
        allocation  of  system  resources) for batch jobs and timesharing
        jobs.

        Normally, if your installation is making use of the TOPS-20 class
        scheduling  of  jobs,  the  scheduling  classes are set up in the
        n-CONFIG.CMD file at system startup.  The SET  SCHEDULER  command
        allows  you  to  change these classes during timesharing, such as
        when first shift ends and second shift begins.

        You should refer to your  System  Manager  about  job  scheduling
        before you use this command with any of its available arguments.

        The SET STRUCTURE command enters a new structure or  changes  the
        parameters of an existing structure.

        The SET STRUCTURE command enters the parameters  of  a  structure
        into  the  system's structure data base.  The structure data base
        contains a catalog of all the system's mountable  structures  and
        their   parameters.    Whenever   a  structure  is  mounted,  the
        parameters  in  the  structure  data  base  take  effect.   These
        parameters do not change if the system crashes or is shut down.

        You can display the contents of the structure data base with  the
        SHOW STATUS STRUCTURE command.

        ACKNOWLEDGED       specifies that  structure  attributes  can  be
                           changed  only  with the SET STRUCTURE command.
                           If a structure attribute is  changed  by  some

                           The opposite state of ACKNOWLEDGED is IGNORED.
                           When  a  new  structure  is  entered  into the

                           ACKNOWLEDGED.

        AVAILABLE          specifies that the structure is  available  so
                           that users can MOUNT the structure.

                           The   opposite   state   of    AVAILABLE    is
                           UNAVAILABLE.   When a new structure is entered

                           state is AVAILABLE.

        DOMESTIC           specifies that the structure with its alias is
                           to  be DOMESTIC.  A user can ACCESS or CONNECT
                           to  his  directory  on  a  DOMESTIC  structure
                           without giving a password.

                           The opposite state  of  DOMESTIC  is  FOREIGN.
                           When  a  new  structure  is  entered  into the

        DUMPABLE           specifies  to  allow  continuable  dumps  when
                           Dump-On-BUGCHK   is  enabled.   Dump-On-BUGCHK
                           (DOB) allows the system to take a  dump  at  a
                           time  specified by the System Manager, without
                           discontinuing system process  time.   This  is
                           referred  to  as  a  "continuable"  dump.  The
                           structure must be up  and  spinning,  but  the
                           structure  need not be MOUNTed.  The structure
                           must have a valid <SYSTEM>DUMP.EXE  file.   If
                           this  file  does  not exist or is invalid, the
                           structure is ignored when a  continuable  dump
                           occurs.

                           This SET command makes the structure  dumpable
                           regardless  of  any  system  reloads,  because

                           structure.

        EXCLUSIVE          specifies  that  the  structure   in   a   CFS
                           configuration  is  available  only to users on
                           the system that set the structure EXCLUSIVE.

                           The opposite state  of  EXCLUSIVE  is  SHARED.
                           When  a  new structure is mounted, its default
                           state is SHARED.  A structure set EXCLUSIVE on
                           one  CFS  system  should be set UNAVAILABLE on
                           all other systems in the CFS configuration.

        FOREIGN            specifies the structure with the alias  to  be
                           FOREIGN.   A  user must always give a password
                           to ACCESS or  CONNECT  to  a  directory  on  a
                           FOREIGN structure.

                           The opposite state  of  FOREIGN  is  DOMESTIC.
                           When  a  new  structure  is  entered  into the
                           structure data  base,  its  default  state  is
                           FOREIGN.   The  primary  public  structure  is
                           always  DOMESTIC.   An  attempt  to  set  this
                           structure FOREIGN is ignored by the system.

        IGNORED            specifies that the structure is not under  the
                           control  of  the  Mountable  Device Allocator.
                           Only privileged  users  can  change  structure
                           attributes  and  mount the structure, and only
                           by using direct monitor calls.

                           While the structure is in  an  IGNORED  state,
                           SET STRUCTURE commands are accepted but do not
                           take  effect  until  the  structure   is   set
                           ACKNOWLEDGED.   Also,  a  structure  cannot be
                           DISMOUNTED  through   the   mountable   device
                           allocator unless it is set ACKNOWLEDGED.

                           If the structure has already been MOUNTed by a
                           user  when the structure is set IGNORED, users
                           can continue to MOUNT the structure.   If  the
                           structure  is  not  MOUNTed  when  it  is  set
                           IGNORED, users cannot MOUNT the structure.

                           The opposite state of IGNORED is ACKNOWLEDGED.

        The SET TAPE-DRIVE command sets the availability  characteristics
        of a particular tape-drive device.  With the use of this command,
        you can allow or disallow  users  from  requesting  tapes  to  be
        mounted  on  the  tape  drives.   In addition, you can initialize
        tapes with the SET TAPE-DRIVE  command.   You  must  specify  the
        logical  tape-drive  name,  and  either  the  keyword  AVAILABLE,
        INITIALIZE, or UNAVAILABLE.

   Arguments   Arguments

        AVAILABLE          specifies that this particular tape drive  can
                           be  used  to satisfy user tape mount requests.
                           This  argument  cancels  the  effect  of   the
                           UNAVAILABLE  argument.   Once  this command is
                           given, the tape drive remains AVAILABLE  until
                           it is set UNAVAILABLE.

        INITIALIZE         specifies that the tape drive  is  unavailable
                           for  user mount requests and that the drive is
                           being used by  you  to  initialize  tapes.   A
                           labeled  tape  is initialized when you write a
                           volume identification at the beginning of  the
                           tape.   An  unlabeled tape is initialized when
                           you write a record of 80  null  characters  at
                           the beginning of the tape.  When the specified
                           number of tapes  have  been  INITIALIZEd,  the
                           tape drive automatically becomes available for
                           user mount requests.  You specify  the  number
                           of  tapes  to  be initialized with the /COUNT:
                           switch.

        UNAVAILABLE        specifies  that  this  particular  tape  drive
                           cannot  be  used  to  satisfy  user tape mount
                           requests.  This argument cancels the effect of
                           the   AVAILABLE  argument.   If  the  user  is
                           currently using a tape on this tape drive, the
                           tape  drive becomes unavailable after the user
                           completes his work.  If the system crashes  or
                           is  shutdown, the command SET TAPE-DRIVE MTAn:
                           UNAVAILABLE remains in effect after the system
                           is in operation again.

                                                NOTE

                               Drives that are set UNAVAILABLE can be
                               ASSIGNed  by  user  jobs.   This could
                               pose a security problem, as  no  label
                               processing    or    verification    is
                               performed by the system when  using  a
                               tape on an UNAVAILABLE drive.

                           When you specify UNAVAILABLE, you can enter  a
                           single-  or multiple-line reason and terminate

|       /CLUSTER-NODE:cluster-node-name
|  
|                          specifies the particular cluster  node  within
|                          the  TOPS-20  cluster  where  the  command  is
|                          processed.  The "cluster-node-name"  qualifier
|                          can  be any node name within the cluster or an
|                          asterisk  (*).   The  asterisk  specifies  all
|                          nodes within the cluster.

        /COUNT:nn          specifies the  number  (nn)  of  tapes  to  be
                           initialized.    The   /COUNT:    switch,  when
                           specified,   provides    a    mechanism    for
                           initialization of multiple tapes with the same
                           attributes.  Each tape prompts you with a WTOR
                           message  for the volume identification.  After
                           initialization,  the  tape  is   automatically
                           unloaded and the tape drive is ready to accept
                           the next tape to  initialize.   When  as  many
                           tapes as specified by the /COUNT:  switch have
                           been initialized, the tape  drive  returns  to
                           the AVAILABLE state.

        /DENSITY:nn        specifies the BPI (bits-per-inch)  density  of
                           the  tapes to be initialized.  The number (nn)
                           can be 200, 556, 800, 1600, or 6250.   If  you
                           do  not  specify  the  /DENSITY:   switch, the
                           density defaults to 1600 BPI.

        /INCREMENT:nn      specifies the numeric value (nn) by  which  to
                           increment  the  tape  volumes.  This switch is
                           ignored  unless  you  also  use  the   /COUNT:
                           switch    and   specify   a   numeric   volume
                           identification (see the /VOLID:  switch)  that
                           contains  no  leading  zeros.   If  you do not
                           include this switch but do specify  a  numeric
                           volume identification that contains no leading
                           zeros, the default numeric value is 1.

        /LABEL-TYPE:type   specifies the type of label to be  written  on
                           the  tape.   The  type  can  be  ANSI, EBCDIC,
                           TOPS-20, or UNLABELED.  If you do not  specify
                           the   /LABEL-TYPE:   switch,  the  default  is

                           should specify YES to prevent the  tape  drive
                           from  "running away" when MOUNTR tries to read
                           a label from the tape.  If you do not  specify
                           this switch, the default is NO.

        /OWNER:name        specifies the name of the owner of the tape(s)
                           to  be  initialized.  This switch affects only
                           to TOPS-20 label types.  If you do not specify
                           the  /OWNER:   switch, the tape is initialized
                           as a scratch tape.

        /PROTECTION:nnnnnn

                           specifies  a  6-digit  octal  number  as   the
                           protection  number of the tape.  The number is
                           usually from 000000 (so that no  one  can  use
                           the tape) through 777777 (where anyone can use
                           the  tape).   If  you  do  not   specify   the
                           /PROTECTION:   switch,  the default is 777777.
                           This switch is ignored if the  label  type  is

        /TAPE-DISPOSITION:condition

                           specifies what is to be done to the tape after

                           either HOLD or UNLOAD.  If you  specify  HOLD,
                           the  tape  is initialized and is not unloaded.
                           A user requesting the tape can use it  without
                           your  having  to  reload  it.   If you specify

                           unloaded  from the tape drive.  The default is
                           UNLOAD.   If  a  value  greater  than   1   is
                           specified   by   the   /COUNT:    switch,  the

        The SHOW command shows (or displays) information from the system.
        The  SHOW  command  does not alter or change any jobs, queues, or
        devices.  The SHOW command can be issued before a particular job,
        queue,  or  device  has  been  changed; and then it can be issued
        after the change to check to see if  the  particular  change  was
        satisfactory.

        Because the SHOW command is complex,  having  multiple  keywords,
        subkeywords,  parameters, switches, and numeric values, each SHOW
        keyword command is described in the same format as an  individual

|                          the  remote   VMS   node.    The   "queuename"
|                          specifies  the  VMS  queuename  and  can  be a
|                          string of 1 to 31  characters,  consisting  of
|                          alphanumeric  characters, underscores, dashes,

        The SHOW CONTROL-FILE command displays  the  control  file  of  a
        batch  job  that is processing in a particular batch stream.  The
        only keyword for this command is  BATCH-STREAM  followed  by  the
        stream number.  You must specify the BATCH-STREAM keyword.

        Some of the advantages of this command is that it enables you  to
        display  a  particular stream while the job is processing, to see
        any possible problems that might come about due to  an  incorrect
        command, and to check whether there are any commands that require
        an operator action of some kind.

        The  SHOW  PARAMETERS  command  displays  information   about   a
        particular  device  or  range  of  devices,  showing  its current
        defaults and values.  The  device  can  be  a  batch  stream,  an
        input/output unit number, or all devices known to the system.

        The SHOW PARAMETERS command is  very  useful  when  you  want  to
        change  the  defaults of a particular device.  You can issue this
        command to check the parameters before and after the changes have
        been made.

        If you do not  specify  any  keyword  with  the  SHOW  PARAMETERS
        command, the command defaults to all devices.

        The SHOW ROUTE-TABLE command displays the routing tables  of  the
        nodes  whose  output  has  been transferred by means of the ROUTE
        command.   (Refer  to  the  ROUTE  command  description  in  this
        chapter.)

        The SHOW ROUTE-TABLE command has no keywords and no switches.

        The SHOW ROUTE-TABLE command is applicable at  your  installation
        only  if  your  installation  has  remote  station  communication
        software.

        The SHOW STATUS command displays the current information about  a
        particular device or range of devices, showing its current status
        within the  system.   The  device  can  be  a  batch  stream,  an
        input/output  unit number, a tape-drive name, a structure name, a
        node, or all current devices known to the system.

        The SHOW STATUS command is useful  when  you  want  to  know  the
        current  status  of  the  system.   You can issue this command to
        check whether any devices are active or idle.

        If you do not specify any keyword with the SHOW  STATUS  command,
        the command defaults to batch streams, printers, and readers.  If
        your installation has a card punch, paper-tape punch, or plotter,
        the status of these devices are also displayed when no keyword is
        specified.

                           where   the   command   is   processed.    The
                           "cluster-node-name"  can  be  any  node   name
                           within  the  cluster  or an asterisk (*).  The
                           asterisk  specifies  all  nodes   within   the
                           cluster.

        The following switches are optional for the DISK-DRIVE keyword:

        /ALL               specifies  that  both  free  disk  drives  and
                           mounted disk drives be displayed.  This switch
                           is assumed if you do not specify a switch.

        /FREE              specifies that only those disk drives that are
                           available for structure mounts be displayed.

        /MOUNTED           specifies that only those disk drives that are
                           currently   mounted   and  being  accessed  be
                           displayed.

        /ALL               specifies  that  both  mounted  and  unmounted
                           structures   be  displayed.   This  switch  is
                           assumed if you do not specify a switch.

        /MOUNTED           specifies that only those structures that  are
                           currently mounted be displayed.

        /UNMOUNTED         specifies that only those structures that  are
                           free for mounting be displayed.

        The following switches are optional for the TAPE-DRIVE keyword:

        /ALL               specifies that all tape drives  known  to  the
                           system  be displayed.  The status display also
                           provides additional information, such  as  the
                           AVR  status,  the  label-type, and the density
                           (BPI).  If you do not specify the /ALL switch,
                           the  additional information does not appear in
                           the status display.

        /CHARACTERISTICS   specifies that the status display contain  the
                           characteristics of all tape drives or one tape
                           drive if  you  specify  the  tape  drive  name

        The STOP command temporarily stops one of  six  possible  devices
        that are currently idle or processing a particular job.

        The STOP command only temporarily stops the device and the device
        is  still  active.   The  device has not been terminated and jobs
        requesting that device can still be scheduled.

        To re-activate the particular device after  a  STOP  command  has
        been issued, give the CONTINUE command.  Refer to the description
        of the CONTINUE command in this chapter.

        this command does not cause printing to occur  across  the  forms
        page burst (perforation).

        The SUPPRESS command is very useful  when  you  want  to  stop  a
        user's  program  that  caused  a print loop, for example when bad
        code causes too many form feeds.  When this happens, you can stop
        the  printer,  issue  the SUPPRESS command, and then continue the
        printer, thus saving a lot of paper.

        The SUPPRESS command's only keyword  is  PRINTER  with  its  unit
        number  and,  optionally,  the  node  name  or  number.  You must
        specify the PRINTER keyword.

                           was  originally  queued  to  process  multiple
                           files.    (Refer   to   the   BACKSPACE    and
                           FORWARDSPACE commands.)

        /JOB               specifies the current job being printed.  With
                           the /JOB switch, the entire job is suppressed,
                           regardless of how many files or switches  were
                           specified  when  the job was originally queued
                           to print.  The /JOB switch is the  default  of
                           the SUPPRESS command.

        /STOP              specifies  a  switch  used  to  resume  normal
                           printing  and stop the suppression of carriage
                           control on the line printer.  When you specify
                           this   switch,   the  job  that  is  currently
                           printing reverts to the print job format  that
                           occurred   before  the  SUPPRESS  command  was

   Function   Function

        The SWITCH command switches a tape-mount request from one  volume
        to another that is on another tape drive.  This command should be
        used when a user program wishes to switch volumes without issuing
        another tape MOUNT request.

        In particular, this command is useful when  you  want  to  handle
        tape  volume  switching for unlabeled tapes used by certain COBOL
        programs.

        The UNDEFINE command removes a structure's  attribute  definition
        from the structure data base.  The structure data base contains a
        list of all the system's structures and  their  parameters.   You
        can display the contents of the structure data base with the SHOW
        STATUS STRUCTURE command.

        Use the UNDEFINE command when a structure in the  structure  data
        base is no longer used.  You can also use the UNDEFINE command if
        you incorrectly enter a new structure name with the SET STRUCTURE
        command.

   Function   Function

        The WAIT command causes OPR to wait a specified number of seconds
        before accepting input.

        The WAIT command is used in batch control files to try to prevent
        OPR  from  accepting a command before a previously issued command
        has been processed.

        The OPR program  is  designed  to  accept  and  process  commands
        immediately,  and the batch system (BATCON) will send commands to
        OPR as soon as the previous command is accepted.

        Most OPR commands require processing  by  other  modules  of  the
        operating  system.   OPR can accept a command, dispatch it to the
        appropriate module, and accept another  command  from  the  batch
        file  before  the  output  from the first command returns to OPR.
        For example, it is possible for an EXIT command in the batch file
        to  be processed before the response to previously issued command
        is displayed.  The WAIT command should  be  entered  between  the
        previous command and the EXIT command, to allow the first command
        to finish processing before the EXIT command is sent to OPR.

        where n is the number of seconds  that  OPR  should  wait  before

        must be between 1 and 60.


   Warning   Warning

        Using the WAIT command does NOT guarantee that  the  output  from
        the  first command will be successfully displayed before the EXIT
        command is accepted and processing by OPR.   OPR  will,  however,
        WAIT  the  specified  number  of seconds, and the output from the
        first command will  be  displayed  if  it  is  ready  before  the
        specified number of seconds is up.

        The following batch file may be submitted to the batch system:

             $OPR
             *SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE
             *EXIT

        When this job is processed, the SHOW STATUS command is issued and
        accepted  by  OPR,  passed  to ORION for processing, and then the
        output is passed back through OPR  to  BATCON.   However,  BATCON
        will  send  the EXIT command immediately after OPR dispatches the
        SHOW STATUS command.  When OPR  receives  the  EXIT  command,  it
        causes  the  batch  job  to exit from OPR immediately, before the
        output from SHOW STATUS is received by OPR.

        The WAIT command is used to cause OPR to WAIT for  the  specified
        number  of  seconds  before  accepting  the  EXIT  command.   The
        following batch file would probably work successfully:

             @ENABLE
             $OPR
             *SHOW STATUS TAPE-DRIVE

   4.1  INTRODUCTION   4.1  INTRODUCTION

   LCP is the LAT Control Program.   LAT  is  the  Local  Area  Transport
   protocol,   used  to  control  communication  between  LAT  hosts  and
   terminals on the  Ethernet.   LCP  allows  you  to  perform  LAT  host
   management functions at a TOPS-20 host.

                                  WARNING

           The  LCP  commands  described  in  this  chapter   can
           seriously  affect  system performance.  If you are not
           sure of what you are doing, do not use LCP commands to
           set or clear LAT parameters.

                                    NOTE

           This introduction describes the  LAT  protocol  as  it
           pertains  to  TOPS-20  LAT  hosts.   The  LCP  command
           descriptions in this chapter apply only  to  LAT  host
           management  functions  on  TOPS-20  nodes.   For  more
           information about LAT architecture  and  LAT  Terminal

   To run LCP, you must first run OPR, and therefore  must  have  OPR  or
   WHEEL privileges enabled.

   Many hundreds of hosts and terminals can  be  connected  on  the  same
   Ethernet.   LAT  terminal  servers  allow terminal users to connect to
   TOPS-20 hosts that are connected to the same Ethernet.  There must  be
   corresponding  server  software  in the host.  The host server and the
   terminal server use the  LAT  protocol  to  enable  the  (potentially)
   thousands of communications links to efficiently utilize the Ethernet.
   Users do not need to be aware of the LAT servers.

   Three types of parameters control the action of  a  TOPS-20  LAT  host

   server:

         o  permanent

         o  static

         o  dynamic

   You can change permanent parameters only by  rebuilding  the  monitor.
   You can change static parameters by editing n-CONFIG.CMD and reloading
   the monitor.  You can change dynamic  parameters  with  LCP  commands.
   LAT operation and some dynamic parameters are discussed below.

   There is one physical connection between all hosts  and  LAT  terminal
   servers:   the Ethernet.  All communication is transmitted on that one
   physical connection.  All communication between users of a  particular
   LAT  terminal server and a particular host is transmitted on a logical
   connection known as a  virtual  circuit.   Software  in  the  terminal
   server  and  in the host ensures that each message is delivered to the
   correct destination.

   Each message received (by  a  host  or  a  terminal  server)  must  be
   acknowledged  by the receiver.  The acknowledgement can be included in
   a data message, or can be sent as a separate message when there is  no
   data.   If  a  host does not receive an acknowledgement from a server,
   the host can send one more message to that server, at which  time  the
   host   starts  its  retransmit  timer.   When  the  host  receives  an
   acknowledgement from the server, this timer is stopped.  If  the  host
   receives  no  acknowledgement and the host's retransmit timer expires,
   the host retransmits all unacknowledged messages  to  the  server  and
   restarts  the  timer.   The  host  can  retransmit  these  messages  a
   specified number of times, known as the retransmit limit.  You can use
   LCP  commands  to  change  the  host's retransmit timer and retransmit
   limit in response to network load.

   Hosts present themselves to users of terminal servers  as  "services".
   Dynamic parameters associated with the services, such as service-name,
   group, and service-rating, let you control access  to  the  hosts.   A
   host  can  offer more than one service.  For example, a host can offer
   one service that is the host itself, and another service that  is  the
   host as part of a cluster.

   Service-names identify the services to users of the terminal  servers.
   The  service-name can be the host's node name.  More than one host can
   use the same service-name, letting you identify a cluster of hosts  as
   one  service.   The  fact  that  two  or  more  services have the same
   service-name is transparent to the user.

   The ratings of identically named services determine to which host  the
   connection  will  be  made.   You  can set the rating to be an integer
   between 0 and 255, or  you  can  set  it  to  be  dynamic.   The  host


                                    4-2
                                LCP COMMANDS                                LCP COMMANDS



   periodically updates a dynamic rating to be

                 255 - (4 * 15-minute load average)

   When a user requests a connection to a service that is offered by  two
   hosts,  the connection is made to the service with the highest rating.
   Terminal  servers  and  host  services  are  organized  into   logical
   categories  called  groups.   Each  group  is identified by an integer
   between zero and 255 that  controls  access  to  the  service  by  the
   terminal  server.   A service or a terminal server can be in more than
   one group.  Terminal servers can connect only to services  with  which
   they  have  a group in common.  For example, a terminal server that is
   in group 2 (only) can connect to a service only  if  that  service  is
   also  a  member  of  group 2.  By default, all terminal servers are in
   group zero.  Therefore, a service that is in group zero  (the  TOPS-20
   default)  is  accessible  to all terminal servers unless you clear the
   terminal server from group zero.

   At intervals determined by its multicast-timer, each host broadcasts a
   multicast message (a message to all terminal servers on the Ethernet),
   listing the services that the host offers.  This message also contains
   information  about  service-ratings  and  the  host's  groups.  Before
   sending  the  multicast  message,  the  host   updates   any   dynamic
   service-ratings.

   In response to a user request, a terminal server displays  a  list  of
   services  that  consists  of only those services to which the terminal
   server can connect.  Each service is identified by a service-name  and
   a service-identification string.  When the user logs in to the service
   (using the servicename), the host displays the  service-identification
   string.   This  is  a  descriptive  message about the service, such as
   "Node A of cluster ABC".  You can set and change the service-name  and
   service-identification with LCP commands.

                           switch  or   the   /NODISPLAY   switch.    The
                           /NODISPLAY switch is the default if you do not
                           specify either switch.

                           TAKE (see above) commands from a file, to give
                           each command time to execute.

   activity  associated  with the host on which you are running LCP.  For
   example, LCP commands:

         o  Clear LAT parameters.

         o  Set LAT parameters.

         o  Show the current parameters,  terminal  connections,  counter
            and server information.

         o  Change certain counter settings to zero.

   This chapter explains how to enter and exit LCP, and describes the LCP
   commands listed below.

         o  CLEAR

         o  SET

         o  SHOW

         o  START

                The LCP commands described in  this  chapter  can
                seriously  affect system performance.  If you are
                not sure of what you are doing, do  not  use  LCP
                commands to set or clear LAT parameters.

   You start the LCP program from within OPR.  To enter LCP use  the  OPR
   command, ENTER, as shown below.

   There are three ways to exit LCP:

         o  You can exit LCP and return to OPR command level.

         o  You can exit LCP and return to monitor command level.

         o  You can exit LCP by entering another command level, such as
            NCP.

   To return to OPR command level, use the RETURN command as below:

        MAXIMUM ACTIVE-CIRCUITS

                           changes to 20 the maximum  number  of  virtual
                           circuits  that can simultaneously be connected
                           to your host.

        MAXIMUM SESSIONS   changes  the  maximum  number  of  active  LAT
                           terminals allowed to connect to the host.  The
                           new  value  is  the  maximum  number  of   LAT
                           terminals   allowed   in   the   host   system
                           configuration.

        MULTICAST-TIMER    changes   the   time   period   set   on   the
                           multicast-timer    to    30    seconds.    The
                           multicast-timer  specifies  the  interval   at
                           which  the  host transmits a multicast message
                           announcing host services that are available to
                           LAT terminal servers.

        NUMBER             resets the host identification number to  that
                           specified in n-CONFIG.CMD.

        RETRANSMIT LIMIT   changes to 30 the number of times that  a  LAT
                           host can retransmit unacknowledged messages to
                           the   server.    After   the   last    message
                           transmission,   the  host  detaches  all  jobs
                           associated with the virtual  circuit  to  that
                           server.

        RETRANSMIT TIMER   changes  the   setting   of   the   LAT   host
                           retransmit-timer   to   1000  milliseconds  (1
                           second).  The retransmit-timer  specifies  the
                           amount of time before the host retransmits any
                           unacknowledged  messages   to   the   terminal
                           server.

        SERVICE-NAME text  cancels the service identified by service-name
                           text.   The  CLEAR  SERVICE-NAME  command also
                           clears   all   RATING    and    IDENTIFICATION
                           information associated with service text.

                                                NOTE

                               If   there   is   only   one   service
                               associated  with  a  host,  you cannot

        GROUPS n             specifies for the host a group, a  range  of
                             groups,  or  a  list  that  can contain both
                             single  groups  and  group   ranges.    Only
                             terminal servers that have the corresponding
                             groups set can connect to the host.   Groups
                             can  be  integers  from  0  to 255.  You can
                             specify any combination of ranges or  single
                             numbers,  separated  by commas.  Zero is the
                             default.  For example:

                                  SET GROUPS 7:9, 22, 45:49
                                  SET GROUPS 8, 12, 14:17

        IDENTIFICATION "quoted string"

                             specifies host  identification  information.
                             This    host    identification   is   purely
                             descriptive, and is  displayed  when  a  LAT
                             terminal  server  displays information about
                             the host node.  You can specify a string  of
                             up  to  64  characters.  You can include any
                             printable characters.  You must enclose  the
                             string  in  double  quotes (").  This string
                             defaults to the  system  banner  defined  in

                             the host.  MAXIMUM ACTIVE-CIRCUITS can be an
                             integer  between  1 and 173, inclusive.  The
                             default is 20.

                             terminals  that can be connected to the host
                             at one time.   MAXIMUM SESSIONS  can  be  an
                             integer  between  1  and 50, inclusive.  The
                             default is the maximum number  of  terminals
                             allowed in your system configuration.

        MULTICAST-TIMER n    sets the interval (in seconds) at which  the
                             host  transmits  to  all servers a multicast
                             message announcing  the  services  available
                             from   that   host.    You   can   set   the
                             MULTICAST-TIMER to an integer between 8  and
                             48, inclusive.  The default is 30 seconds.

          NUMBER n           specifies  a  unique   host   identification
                             number.

          RETRANSMIT LIMIT n sets the maximum number of  times  that  the
                             host  retransmits unacknowledged messages to
                             the server.  If the  final  transmission  is
                             not acknowledged, the host detaches all jobs
                             associated with the virtual circuit  to  the
                             server.   The  RETRANSMIT LIMIT  can  be  an
                             integer between 0 and  64,  inclusive.   The
                             default is 60.

          RETRANSMIT TIMER n sets the host retransmit-timer.  This  timer
                             determines    the   amount   of   time   (in
                             milliseconds) before  the  host  retransmits
                             any  unacknowledged  messages to the server.
                             The  RETRANSMIT TIMER  can  be  set  to   an
                             integer  between  100 (.1 second) and 100000
                             (100  seconds).    The   default   is   2000
                             milliseconds (1 second).

          SERVICE-NAME text  specifies that the  host  offers  a  service
                             named  text.   Users  select the name of the
                             service, rather than the name  of  the  host
                             when  they  request the server to initiate a
                             terminal session.  The  SERVICE-NAME  (text)
                             can  be  up  to  16 characters long, and can
                             contain any alphanumeric characters,  dollar
                             sign ($), hyphen (-), and underscore (_).

                           When you select a service name that is used by
                           more  than  one  available  host,  the  server
                           connects  you  to  the  host  with the highest
                           rating.  You can specify n as  an  integer  in

                           (specified by SERVICE-NAME).  You can  specify
                           a  string  of  up  to  64 characters.  You can

   5.1  INTRODUCTION   5.1  INTRODUCTION

   The commands in this chapter  must  be  given  with  a  ^E  (<CTRL/E>)
   preceding  the command and these commands can affect the entire system
   or a specific user.  Thus, these commands  are  called  ^E  Privileged
   Commands.

   Because these commands can easily destroy your system security,  their
   usage  is  restricted  to users who have WHEEL or OPERATOR capability.
   WHEEL capability  allows  you  to  execute  all  privileged  commands.
   OPERATOR capability allows you to execute only the privileged commands
   relevant to system operations.

   WHEEL and OPERATOR capabilities can be  granted  when  you  create  or
   change  a  directory.   Normally,  the  user  name OPERATOR, which you
   should be using, has the OPERATOR capability.

   Before you can successfully issue a privileged command, you must  type
   the  ENABLE  command  to  enable  your capabilities.  If you are using
   recognition input, the command is ENABLE (CAPABILITIES).  Once you are
   enabled, the prompt character changes from @ to $.  For example,

         ______ ___________________        @ENABLE (CAPABILITIES)<RET>
        $

                                    NOTE

           Even if you do not have WHEEL or OPERATOR  capability,
           ENABLE changes the prompt to $.

   Once you are at privileged  command  level,  you  must  type  <CTRL/E>
   before  each  command.   The  <CTRL/E>  prints as ^E on your terminal.
   Then type the remainder of the command.  There are nine (9) privileged
   commands and most of them have subcommands.

   If you do not have the privileges needed to execute the command or you
   have not typed ENABLE, you get the message:


                                    5-1
                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS



        ?Unrecognized command

   and your terminal is at operating system command level.

   When  you  complete  a  privileged  command,  disable   your   special
   capabilities  by  typing  DISABLE.  The prompt character changes to @.
   For example,

         ____________        $DISABLE<RET>
        @

                                    NOTE

           It is very important that you give the DISABLE command
           after  you  use  a privileged command.  This safeguard
           protects you against accidentally damaging part of the
           system.

   In the following sections of  each  privileged  command,  <CTRL/E>  is
   indicated by ^E.  Where you would press the RETURN key is indicated by
   the <RET> symbol.  You can abbreviate a privileged command  by  typing
   as  few  of the beginning characters as are needed to make the command
   unique.  Recognition with  guide  words  is  given  with  the  command
   formats.

   You can easily get a list of all ^E commands by typing ENABLE<RET> AND
   THEN  <CTRL/E>?   (question  mark).   The following is printed on your
   terminal.

         ___________        @ENABLE<RET>
        $^E? one of the following:
           CEASE  CREATE    DEFINE    EDDT      PRINT     QUIT      SEND
           SET    SPEAK

                           does not need to be specified.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        After you type the ^ECEASE command and press RETURN,  the  system
        outputs  the name of the system to be shutdown (displayed only if
|       the system is part of a DECnet or INTERNET network) and the  time
        of the scheduled shutdown.  For example:

             BADGER Shutdown scheduled for 4-Apr-84 18:00:00

        If the output is not what you expected, type CTRL/C to abort  the
        command.  Otherwise, confirm the command by pressing RETURN.

        When the command is in effect, downtime and uptime, if specified,
        are  reported to users when they first type CTRL/C or RETURN on a
        terminal.  They receive a message similar to:

             System shutdown scheduled for 22-Apr-84 18:00:00,
             Up again at 22-Apr-84 20:00:00

        When you issue the command,  you  and  users  already  logged  in
        receive one of the following messages.

        If downtime is more than one hour away, the  message  is  similar
        to:

             [System going down at 2-Apr-84 11:30:00]

        If the downtime is 60 or  fewer  minutes  away,  the  message  is
        similar to:

             [System going down in 30 minutes at 2-Apr-84 11:30:00]

        When the downtime is one minute away, the message is:

             [System going down in one minute!!]

        One of the preceding messages is also printed at hourly intervals
        before  downtime  and  30  minutes,  15  minutes,  10  minutes, 5
        minutes, and 1 minute before downtime to indicate how long it  is
        before the actual shutdown.

            minutes

        the following message appears on the CTY and on the  terminal  of
        anyone who is running OPR:

        message also appears on the CTY and on the terminal of anyone who
        is  running OPR at 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes,
                                               _______  __________  _____        and 1 minute before downtime.  See the TOPS-20  Operator's  Guide
        for more information.

        When downtime is reached, if you specified uptime, a message such
        as the following is printed.

             [System down, up again at 2-Apr-84 12:00:00]

        When downtime occurs, SHUTDOWN COMPLETE is printed  on  the  CTY.
        All jobs are then logged out, except the CTY, so PTYCON continues
        to run.  Processes under  SYSJOB  continue  to  run,  but  PTYCON
        subjobs  are  logged  out.   Then,  no further LOGINs are allowed
        except from the CTY.

        To cancel an existing plan for a shutdown, type ^ECEASE and press
        RETURN.  Then you and all users receive the message:

             [Shutdown cancelled]

        If you do not know the uptime, omit it by pressing  RETURN  after
        (RESUMING AT).  The message output to users before they log in is
        similar to:

             System shutdown scheduled for 2-Apr-84 16:30:00

        The uptime is  only  informational;  it  does  not  initiate  any
        automatic  startup.  To resume timesharing, you should use ^ESEND
        to say that the system is being reloaded, enter the  PARSER  with
        <CTRL/\>, type SHUTDOWN, and reload via a load switch.

        After giving the command, look at the output message to check the
        dates  and  times.  The output times are based on a 24-hour clock

        for example, twelve is  added  to  the  hours  between  noon  and
        midnight.  The times are given as hh:mm:ss, where hh is the hour,
        mm is the minute, and ss is the second.

        If you use AM or PM in the time, do not put a space before either
        of  them.  For example, 6:00 PM causes the error message "INVALID
        DATE FORMAT" explained in the Restrictions  section  below.   You
        must use 6:00PM.

        For the time, you must specify minutes if you are also specifying
        hours,  for  example, for 6p.m.  you must use 6:00PM or 1800.  If
        you use 6PM, it is interpreted as 12:06p.m..

        If you give the command with an incorrect date  or  time,  retype
        the command correctly.

        Error messages associated with the ^ECEASE command are:

        ?Downtime has already passed

             The time you specified for downtime has already gone by.

        ?Downtime cannot be more than 7 days in the future

             You specified a downtime that was too far in the future.

        ?Invalid date format

             You typed an unacceptable date or you typed a  space  before
             AM  or  PM,  which  causes  the  time  specified  not  to be
             recognized as time format.

        <directory>        specifies the name of the directory  that  you
                           want  to create or alter.  The name is 1 to 39
                           alphanumeric  characters,  including  hyphens,
                           underlines, and dollar signs.  Angle or square
                           brackets must enclose the name.  This name  is
                           used  when  a  user  tries  to  log  in to the
                           system,  connect  to  a  directory,  access  a
                           directory,  or  change  directory  parameters.
                           You can use recognition on this  name  if  the
                           directory already exists.

        password           specifies 1 to 39 letters, digits, or hyphens.
                           You  can omit the password here and specify it
                           later in  a  subcommand.   You  can  omit  the
                           password    completely    for   a   files-only
                           directory.  The password is used when  a  user
                           tries  to  log  in to the system, connect to a
                           directory,  access  a  directory,  or   change
                           directory parameters.

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        To create a directory on a structure, the directory name  in  the
        ^ECREATE  command  must  be different from any existing directory
        name on the structure and must be enclosed in angle brackets.  If
        the  directory name contains one or more periods (.), for example
        <T.YOW>, the directory is a subdirectory.  Before you can  create
        a  subdirectory, you must first create its superior directory, in
        this case <T>.  You can determine the superior  directory  for  a
        subdirectory   by   using   the  name  of  the  subdirectory  and
        eliminating the last period (.) and the characters after it.  For
        example,  the  superior  directory for <FP.BONS> is <FP>, and the
        superior directory for <R.ACE.LT.MEM> is <R.ACE.LT>.

        After you type the ^ECREATE command using either format and press
        RETURN, the system outputs [NEW] or [OLD] on the next line and $$
        on the following line.  Be sure you check this output.  If  [NEW]
        is  printed,  you are creating a directory.  If [OLD] is printed,
        you are altering an existing directory.  If  the  output  is  not
        what  you  expected,  type  ABORT<RET>  and  retype  the ^ECREATE
        command.  The $$ (double-dollar-signs)  indicates  that  you  can
        give  a  subcommand  or  press RETURN to finish the command.  The
        ^ECREATE subcommands are  described  under  Subcommands  in  this
        section.

        If  you  are  creating  a  directory  and  you  press  RETURN  at
        subcommand  level  without  giving  any subcommands, you create a
        directory with default parameters.  (Refer to Table 5-1  in  this
        section for the default parameters.)

        For example, using recognition input,

        If you use the second format of the ^ECREATE command (see  Format
        section  below),  to  create  a directory and you press RETURN at
        subcommand level without giving any  subcommands,  you  create  a
        directory with default parameters except for the password.

        For example,

              ________                  _____            ________             $^ECREATE (DIRECTORY NAME) <TES> (PASSWORD) XAP<RET>

               _____             $$<RET>
             $

        To change the password for an existing  directory,  you  can  use
        either ^ECREATE command format.  However, one format requires the
        PASSWORD subcommand.  For example,

              ________ ___________            __________             $^ECREATE SQM:<HOGAN> (PASSWORD) JOHNQ<RET>
             [Old]
               _____             $$<RET>
             $

        or

              ________ ________________             $^ECREATE SQM:<HOGAN><RET>
             [Old]
               ________ __________             $$PASSWORD JOHNQ<RET>
               _____             $$<RET>
             $

        Also, see Hint under PASSWORD subcommand,  described  later,  for
        another way of changing a password.

   Subcommand Characteristics   Subcommand Characteristics

        When you give a subcommand, you need to type only  the  beginning
        characters  up  to the point that the abbreviation is unique.  If
        you want to see the guide words, press the ESCape key  after  you
        give  the  subcommand  or its abbreviation.  You can also see the
        help text for the argument by typing ?  (question mark) in  place
        of  the argument.  After the help text is printed, the subcommand
        is repeated up to the argument.  At any point before you end  the
        subcommand, you can delete the subcommand line by typing CTRL/U.

                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS                           ^E PRIVILEGED COMMANDS
                                 (^ECREATE)                                 (^ECREATE)


        To end the subcommand, press  RETURN  or  LINE  FEED.   When  you
        finish  giving subcommands to alter, kill, or create a directory,
        you must type an extra RETURN or LINE FEED for confirmation.

        For the system to ignore the  creation  of  a  directory  or  any
        changes  to  an  old  directory  since  the last ^ECREATE, type a
        CTRL/C any time during the ^ECREATE, or type ABORT at  subcommand
        level, instead or waiting to give the final RETURN or LINE FEED.

                                      NOTE

                Remember that you need to use a  subcommand  only
                if you want to assign a nondefault value when you
                are creating a directory or if you want to change
                any  value  for  an  existing directory.  See the
                Subcommands  Table  for  a  list   of   all   the
                subcommands  and  their  defaults.   You can also
                print the defaults on your terminal by giving the
                LIST  subcommand  to  ^ECREATE before you specify
                any  other  subcommands  (or  you  can  use   the
                INFORMATION  DIRECTORY command at TOPS-20 command
                level).

                If  you  change  a  directory  parameter  for   a
                logged-in  user  and  the user complains that the
                change has not occurred, tell the user to log out
                and  log  in again.  Some directory parameters do
                not take effect until a user logs in.

        The  ^ECREATE  subcommands  and  their  guide  words,  functions,
        arguments,  and  defaults  are given on the following pages.  The
        discussion of a subcommand also contains the explanation  of  any
        corresponding negative function.

        ABORT        ABORT

             This  subcommand  returns  you  to  system   command   level
             immediately.   It is equivalent to typing CTRL/C at any time
             before you give the final <RET> to the ^ECREATE command.  As
             a  result, the system ignores the creation of a directory or
             any changes to an old  directory  since  the  last  ^ECREATE
             command was given.

                                 ----- Example -----

             If you give an incorrect name, you can simply abort and type
             ^ECREATE again with the correct name.

|            This subcommand grants a user the ABSOLUTE INTERNET  SOCKETS
             capability.   This  capability  allows  a  user  to  specify
|            absolute socket numbers in a certain privileged monitor call
|            on a system running TCP/IP.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who

        ACCOUNT-DEFAULT (FOR LOGIN) account        ACCOUNT-DEFAULT (FOR LOGIN) account

             This subcommand specifies  the  default  account  for  users
             logging  into this directory.  A user with a default account
             can press RETURN for the account in the LOGIN  command  when
             logging  into  this  directory, and the account specified in
             this subcommand is used.

             If this subcommand is not given, no default account is  set.
             To eliminate a default account, give this subcommand without
             an  argument.   To  change  a  default  account,  give  this
             subcommand with the new default account as the argument.  At
             some installations,  a  user  can  also  change  an  account
             default with the command SET DIRECTORY ACCOUNT-DEFAULT.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You  can   also   use   ENABLE   and   the   SET   DIRECTORY
             ACCOUNT-DEFAULT command to change the default account.  When
             you  have  OPERATOR  capability  enabled,  you  can  type  a
             fictitious password in the command.

        ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES        ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES

             This subcommand specifies that expired disk files are to  be
             automatically  marked for archiving.  The TOPS-20 Operator's
             Guide discusses archiving.

             NOT  ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES,  which  is  the  default,
             causes  all  files  in  the  directory to remain on the disk
             regardless of the expiration date.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To ensure that user GORE's  files  are  archived  some  time

        CONFIDENTIAL (INFORMATION ACCESS CAPABILITY)        CONFIDENTIAL (INFORMATION ACCESS CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand grants a user the  confidential  information
             access  capability.  This capability lets a user obtain some
             confidential  information  within  the  system  via  certain
             monitor calls.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who

             This subcommand, in conjunction with pre-established  system
             manager  controls, grants a user the capability to establish
             DECnet network connections.  Note that this is  the  default
             in the absence of system manager controls.

             NOT DECNET-ACCESS denies access to the network.  This is the
             default  if  the  system  manager has exercised control over

             This subcommand specifies the default file-access protection
             for   files   within  this  directory.   (You  can  find  an
             explanation of file-access protection in the TOPS-20  User's
             Guide.)  The  argument  for  this command is a 6-digit octal
             number.  If you do not  use  this  subcommand,  the  default
             protection is 777700.

             To change  the  default  file  protection  for  an  existing
             directory,  give this subcommand with the new protection.  A
             user can also change  this  default  with  the  command  SET
             DIRECTORY FILE-PROTECTION-DEFAULT.

             Do not  confuse  this  value  with  the  protection  of  the
             directory,  which  is set with the PROTECTION (OF DIRECTORY)
             subcommand.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You  can   also   use   ENABLE   and   the   SET   DIRECTORY

        DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) decimal group number        DIRECTORY-GROUP (NUMBER) decimal group number

             This subcommand specifies a group number  for  a  directory.
             If  the group number is n, users in group n have group-level
             access to this directory.  (See the subcommand USER-OF-GROUP
             to  put  a  user  into  a  group.) The group-level access is
             determined by the  directory-  and  file-access  protection.
             (Refer  to  the  TOPS-20  User's Guide for an explanation of
             access protection.)

             The argument is a decimal number from 1 to 262143 (2**18-1).
             Because  you  can  specify only one number for the argument,
             you must repeat  the  subcommand  for  each  group  that  is
             allowed  to  access  the  files  in  the directory.  You can
             specify a maximum  of  40  different  group  numbers  for  a
             directory.

             NOT DIRECTORY prevents the directory from being accessed  at
             the group level by users in that group.  Because a directory
             does not belong to any group by default,  NOT  DIRECTORY  is
             needed  to  prohibit group access only if DIRECTORY had been
             given for that group.  You must repeat  the  subcommand  for
             each group for which you want access prohibited.

             Give this capability only to those users who need it and who

             subdirectories of a FILES-ONLY directory must be FILES-ONLY.
             A FILES-ONLY directory cannot receive mail.

             NOT FILES-ONLY, which is the default, allows a user to  give
             the LOGIN and ACCESS commands for the directory.

             If  a  FILES-ONLY  directory  does  not  have  a   password,
             connecting  to  it  depends on directory protection and user
             groups.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             To temporarily disable a user from logging in and leave  his
             files  intact,  simply make his directory FILES-ONLY.  Then,
             to restore his log-in  privilege,  make  his  directory  NOT
             FILES-ONLY.   This  method  does not change any of the other

             This specifies the default number of generations that a file
             can  have in this directory.  The argument must be a decimal
             number from 0 to 63, where 0 means an infinite number.   The
             default  is  1.   Currently,  it  is  advisable  to use this
             default to limit disk usage.

             To change  the  number  of  default  generations,  use  this
             subcommand and specify a new number.  At some installations,
             a user can also change this default  with  the  command  SET

             RETURN  after  [CONFIRM].   When  you  get   the   next   $$
             (double-dollar-signs),  you  can  continue  with the KILL by
             pressing RETURN again or cancel the KILL by typing NOT KILL.

             NOT KILL, which is the default, cancels  a  KILL  subcommand
             when it is given before the ^ECREATE command is completed.

                                  ----- Hints -----

             Do not kill a directory  that  is  logged  in,  because  the
             system  is  not  able  to  use  that user's job number until
             TOPS-20 is reloaded.  If you must kill that  directory,  log
             out the user first and then kill the directory.

             When you kill a directory, you lose all  the  files  in  the
             directory.

             If you try to kill a directory and get:

             the directory is being used.  You cannot kill the  directory
             until it is not in use.

        LIST argument        LIST argument

             This subcommand lets you  check  the  directory  parameters.
             Consequently,  it  helps  to use it before you terminate the
             ^ECREATE command, so you can make any necessary changes.

             The acceptable arguments are FAST, NAME-ONLY,  and  VERBOSE.
             If no argument is typed, FAST is assumed.

                                ----- Arguments -----

             If you type LIST FAST or LIST<RET>, the output  is  a  short
             list  equivalent  to  the  output  from the ^EPRINT command.
             Items not listed have default values.

             If you type LIST NAME-ONLY, the output gives the name of the


                                    5-23

             directory  that  you  specified  after the ^ECREATE command.
             This is equivalent to the output from  the  ^EPRINT  command
             with the NAME-ONLY subcommand.

             If  you  type  LIST  VERBOSE,  the  output  lists  all   the
|            parameters  except  PASSWORD, NOT ABSOLUTE-INTERNET-SOCKETS,
|            and NOT INTERNET-WIZARD.  This is equivalent to  the  output
             from  the  ^EPRINT  command  with  the  VERBOSE  subcommand,
             providing the directory was previously completed.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             If you typed KILL as a subcommand, the LIST output is simply
             KILLED.  For example,

                    _________                  $$KILL<RET>

             This subcommand specifies a limit for the sum of the  number
             of  subdirectories  that can be created in the directory and
             the number of subdirectories that can currently be delegated
             to subdirectories in the directory.  The limit can be from 0
             to 262143.

             A number of subdirectories is delegated when the  value  for
             MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES  is  specified  for a subdirectory in
             the directory.   After  subdirectories  are  delegated,  the
             value  for  MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES in the superior directory
             is automatically decremented by the number delegated.

             The default value is zero.  You can  change  the  value  for
             this parameter by giving the subcommand with a new value.

             If you do not use  this  subcommand,  a  default  number  is
             chosen by TOPS-20.  You should always use the default number
             unless the directory must have a specific number.

             While creating a new directory, you can change  a  directory
             number  you specified by repeating the subcommand with a new
             number or by giving the  subcommand  NUMBER  0  to  get  the

             change this number.

             This subcommand establishes the  tape  expiration  date  for
             files  in  your directory that are to go off line because of
             migration or archiving.  To generate a relative  date,  give
             the  "+n"  argument,  where  n represents the number of days
             from the removal date.

             After issuing this subcommand, you  may  receive  the  error
             message:

                  ?Offline expiration time cannot exceed system maximum.

             In this situation, you have requested a longer  interval  of
             time than that established by the system manager.  Issue the
             INFORMATION (ABOUT) SYSTEM-STATUS command to learn what  the

             This subcommand establishes the  expiration  date  for  disk
             files  that  are  to  be  created  in  the  directory.  Upon
             expiration, the  files  will  be  automatically  marked  for
             archiving     if     you     previously     specified    the
             ARCHIVE-ONLINE-EXPIRED-FILES  subcommand.   To  indicate   a
             relative  date,  give  the "+n" argument, where n represents
             the number of days from the creation date.

        OPERATOR (CAPABILITY)        OPERATOR (CAPABILITY)

             This subcommand  grants  a  user  the  OPERATOR  capability.
             Normally,   it   is   given   to  the  operator's  directory
             <OPERATOR>.

             NOT OPERATOR, which is the default, withholds the capability
             from a user.

             SEMI-OPERATOR  capability  is  a  subset  of  the   OPERATOR
             capability (see SEMI-OPERATOR).

                                 ----- Example -----

        PASSWORD 1 to 39 alphanumeric characters or hyphens        PASSWORD 1 to 39 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

             This subcommand specifies the password for the directory.  A
             user must give his correct password to log in to the system.
             The identifier may be 1 to 39 letters, digits, or hyphens.

             If this subcommand is not given  and  the  password  is  not
             specified  on the same line as ^ECREATE, no password is set.
             To eliminate a password, give  this  subcommand  without  an
             argument.

             You  can  change  an  existing  password  by   giving   this
             subcommand  with the new password.  At some installations, a
             user can  also  change  a  password  with  the  command  SET
             DIRECTORY PASSWORD.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You can also ENABLE your WHEEL  or  OPERATOR  capability  to
             change the password with the SET DIRECTORY PASSWORD command.
             This method  has  the  advantage  of  not  echoing  the  new
             password.

        PERMANENT (DISK STORAGE PAGE LIMIT) argument        PERMANENT (DISK STORAGE PAGE LIMIT) argument

             This subcommand specifies the limit of the sum of disk space
             that  the  directory  can have for permanent storage and the
             disk space that can be delegated to  subdirectories  in  the
             directory for permanent storage.

             Disk space for permanent storage is delegated when the value
             for  PERMANENT  is  specified  for  a  subdirectory  in  the
             directory.  After permanent storage is delegated, the  value
             for  PERMANENT  in  the  superior directory is automatically
             decremented by the amount delegated.

             You should make permanent storage  less  than  or  equal  to
             working   storage.   You  can  change  the  value  for  this
             parameter by giving the subcommand with a new value.

             The arguments are the number of pages or INFINITY.

                                ----- Arguments -----

             The number of pages argument is a  decimal  number  where  a
             page is 512 36-bit words.  The default value is 250 pages.

             The INFINITY argument allocates an unlimited number of pages
             to  the  directory.   The  permanent storage of the superior
             directory must also be INFINITY.  The number of  pages  that
             can  be  used  by  the user is limited to the number of free
             pages on the  structure.   This  argument  is  intended  for
             special  system  directories; it is not intended for general
             users.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To give user FOX 200 pages of permanent storage:

        PRESERVE (SUPERIOR QUOTAS)        PRESERVE (SUPERIOR QUOTAS)

             This  subcommand  preserves  the  values  of  the   superior
             directory's  PERMANENT,  WORKING  and MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES
             parameters.  Normally, when you create a  subdirectory,  the
             PERMANENT,  WORKING,  and MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES subcommands
             subtract equal values from the permanent superior directory.
             The  PRESERVE  subcommand,  when  used  with  the PERMANENT,
             WORKING, and MAXIMUM-SUBDIRECTORIES subcommands, stops  this
             subtraction.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             This subcommand allows you to create a subdirectory  without
             first increasing the pages in the superior directory.

                                 ----- Example -----

             To create a subdirectory for user  FOX  with  100  pages  of
             permanent  and working storage without subtracting 100 pages
             from the  permanent  and  working  quotas  of  the  superior

        PROTECTION (OF DIRECTORY) 6-digit octal number        PROTECTION (OF DIRECTORY) 6-digit octal number

             This  subcommand  specifies  the  access  protection  for  a
             directory.  (You can find an explanation of directory-access
                               _______ ______ _____             protection in the TOPS-20 User's Guide.)  The  argument  for
             this  command  is a 6-digit octal number.  If you do not use
             this subcommand, the directory protection is 777700.

             To change the protection of an existing directory, give this
             subcommand  with the new protection.  A user can also change
             the protection of a directory with the command SET DIRECTORY
             PROTECTION.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             You can also use ENABLE and  the  SET  DIRECTORY  PROTECTION
             command  to  change  the protection.  When you have OPERATOR
             capability enabled, you can type a  fictitious  password  in
             the command.

             one  from  which you issued the ^ECREATE command, and leaves
             your terminal at this new level.  You can issue any  TOPS-20
             command  from this level.  Give the POP command to return to
             your ^ECREATE session.

             With this subcommand you  can  leave  the  ^ECREATE  command
             sequence  in  order  to  issue  a  user,  operator, or other
             privileged command.  Following this, you can resume ^ECREATE
             activities, with your previous work intact.

             You can use the PUSH subcommand to create an  inferior  EXEC
             of  your choice.  Normally, PUSH creates the EXEC defined by
             the system logical name  DEFAULT-EXEC:.   You  can  use  the
             DEFINE  command  to define a job definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:
             with the name of the EXEC you want to create each  time  you
             PUSH.

             Note  that  many  TOPS-20  programs  have  their  own   PUSH
             commands.   However,  only  the  EXEC  and OPR PUSH commands
             refer to the job definition of DEFAULT-EXEC:; all other PUSH
             commands refer to the system definition.

             This subcommand sets  a  TOPS-10  project-programmer  number
             (PPN)  to  the directory.  This allows TOPS-10 programs that
             require PPNs to be compatible with TOPS-20.

             The project-programmer number consists of two octal numbers,

             A  user  can  belong  to  a  maximum of 40 different groups.
             However, because you  can  give  only  one  number  for  the

             group.   If  this  subcommand  is  being  specified  for   a
             subdirectory,  the  user group number must be in the list of
             subdirectory user groups allowed in the superior directory.

             NOT USER-OF-GROUP removes  a  user  from  the  group  number

        WORKING (DISK STORAGE PAGE LIMIT) argument        WORKING (DISK STORAGE PAGE LIMIT) argument

             This subcommand specifies the limit of the sum of  temporary
             working  space that a user of the directory can have on disk
             while logged in and the temporary working space that can  be
             delegated to subdirectories in the directory.

             Temporary working space is  delegated  when  the  value  for
             WORKING  is  specified  for a subdirectory in the directory.
             After temporary working space is delegated,  the  value  for
             WORKING   in   the   superior   directory  is  automatically
             decremented by the amount delegated.

             You should  allow  at  least  as  much  working  storage  as
             permanent  storage.   You  can  change  the  value  for this
             parameter by giving the subcommand with a new value.

             The arguments are the number of pages or INFINITY.

                                ----- Arguments -----

             The number of pages argument is a  decimal  number  where  a
             page is 512 36-bit words.  The default value is 250 pages.

             The INFINITY argument allocates an unlimited number of pages
             to  the  directory.   The  working  storage  of the superior
             directory must also be INFINITY.  The number of  pages  that
             can  be  used  by  the user is limited to the number of free
             pages on the  structure.   This  argument  is  intended  for
             special  system  directories; it is not intended for general

        The ^EDEFINE command creates or deletes system logical names.   A
        system logical name applies to all users on the system.  A system
        logical name is a list  of  system  directories  that  tells  the
        system  where  and  in  what  order  to search for a file for all
        users.

        lognam:            specifies a 1-  to  39-character  alphanumeric
                           abbreviation  or  system  logical  name  to be
                           defined or deleted, or * to delete all  system
                           logical names.

        filespec           specifies  one  or  more  file  specifications
                           separated  by commas.  A file specification is
                           any combination of device or  structure  name,
                           directory    name,    filename,   file   type,
                           generation number, and wild cards.  If you are
                           deleting  a  system  logical name, do not type
                           any file specification.

        Whenever you give this command, you are asked to CONFIRM.  If you
        have  typed the command correctly, press RETURN.  Otherwise, type
        CTRL/U and retype the command.

        Do not confuse the ^EDEFINE command with the TOPS-20 EXEC  DEFINE
        command.   The DEFINE command defines a logical name for only the
        user that issues the command.   (See  the  TOPS-20  User's  Guide
        and/or  TOPS-20 Commands Manual for a complete description of the
        DEFINE command.)

        To check the current  list  of  system  logical  names,  use  the
        command  INFORMATION  (ABOUT)  LOGICAL  NAMES  with  the argument
        SYSTEM.  You should use this command before and after you add  or
        delete a system logical name.  For example:

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The ^EEDDT command should be used only by  a  system  programmer.
        If necessary, it gets DDT from the file SYS.UDDT.EXE and stores a
        symbol table pointer into it.  Normally,  this  command  is  used
        only by a system programmer to debug the EXEC.

   Hint   Hint

        If you get into EDDT by mistake, type $G to get back to the EXEC.
        For example,

              ___________             @ENABLE<RET>
              ___________             $^EEDDT<RET>

        structure          specifies a  1-  to  6-character  alphanumeric

                           directory  information.  If you do not specify
                           a  structure  name,  your  currently-connected
                           structure   is   assumed.   If  you  have  not

                           connected  by default to the public structure.
                           You cannot use recognition  on  the  structure

                           for which you want information.  The directory

        with default values, you seldom need to use VERBOSE.

        You can also use the EXEC command, INFORMATION (ABOUT) DIRECTORY,
        instead of ^EPRINT.

        If you need to change a parameter, use ^ECREATE.

        The following are error  messages  associated  with  the  ^EPRINT
        command:

        ?Invalid structure name

             You specified a structure  name  incorrectly.   Perhaps  you
             omitted  the  angle brackets around a directory name, or you
             omitted the colon after the structure name.

        ?No such directory

             The user name that you  typed  does  not  exist.   Type  the
             command again with a valid user name; try recognition input.

   Function   Function

        The ^EQUIT command halts the EXEC (the TOPS-20 command processor)
        and  returns control to the program under which the EXEC is being
        run.


   Format   Format

        ^EQUIT


   Hint   Hint

        The ^EQUIT command should be used only by  a  system  programmer.
        For  the privileged user the command is normally used to get into
        the MINI-EXEC.  The prompt  to  indicate  that  you  are  in  the
        MINI-EXEC is MX>.  Some commands for the MINI-EXEC are documented
        in the TOPS-20 Software  Installation  Guide,  because  they  are
        useful in the installation process.

        If you get into the  MINI-EXEC  by  mistake,  type  S  after  the
        prompt.   TART will be printed immediately.  Press RETURN and you
        are back at EXEC level with the enable prompt.  (See the  example
        below.)

        Once you use ^EQUIT to enter the  MINI-EXEC,  whenever  you  type
        <CTRL/P>  thereafter,  you enter the MINI-EXEC.  The <CTRL/P> has
        this effect until you log out.


   Restriction   Restriction

        You must have WHEEL capability to execute the ^EQUIT command.  If
        you issue the ^EQUIT command without WHEEL capability, a question
        mark appears and the enabled prompt reappears.  For example,

              ___________             @ENABLE<RET>
              ___________             $^EQUIT<RET>

        message            specifies a message of one  to  six  lines  of
                           text followed by a carriage return.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The ^ESEND command accepts multiple-line messages with up to  six
        lines  of text.  You can continue typing the message past the end
        of a line and  onto  the  next  line,  without  pressing  RETURN.
        ^ESEND  reorganizes  the  message so that any words split between
        two lines appear on the same line on receiving terminals.

        If you want to avoid divided words while typing your message, use
        the hyphen (-) continue character.  At the end of each line, type
        a space and a hyphen, and then press RETURN.

        The  ^ESEND  command  does  not  send   the   message   to   PTYs
        (pseudo-terminals).   When  you  end  the command, the message is
        then printed on the specified terminals.

   Hints   Hints

        Use the TOPS-20 SYSTAT command to determine a user's line number.

        If you wish to begin the message with a question mark  (?),  type
        CTRL/V  before  the  "?".   The CTRL/V allows the "?" to be taken
        literally instead of printing the help text.  Note that CTRL/V is
        required only if the "?" is in the first character position.

             The ^ESET DATE-AND-TIME command, given from any OPR terminal
             in  a CFS cluster, sets the date and time for all systems in
             the cluster.

                                   ----- Hint -----

             If  you  set  the  time  back,  you  can  seriously   affect
             accounting and the compilation of user programs.  Therefore,
             you should notify all users that you had  to  set  the  time
             back.

             After you give the  ^ESET  DATE-AND-TIME  command,  you  can
             check  the  results  with the TOPS-20 DAYTIME command or the

        LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal        LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal

             specifies the terminals from which LOGINs will succeed.  The
             value of terminal can be:

                  ANY-TERMINAL
|                 INTERNET-TERMINALS
                  CONSOLE-TERMINAL
                  DECNET-TERMINALS
                  LOCAL-TERMINALS
                  PSEUDO-TERMINALS
                  REMOTE-TERMINALS

             The argument  (terminal)  you  give  adds  to  the  list  of
             terminals allowed.  It does not change the list to only what
             you just typed.

             Before SYSJOB.RUN is processed at system startup, LOGINs are
             allowed  from  PSEUDO-TERMINALS  and  the  CONSOLE-TERMINAL.
             After SYSJOB.RUN is processed, LOGINs are allowed  from  any
             terminal.

                                         NOTE

                 You cannot use this command to allow LOGINs from LAT
                 terminals.   Use  the  START  command  from  the LCP
                 command set.  See Chapter 4 (LCP COMMANDS) for  more
                 information   about   allowing   LOGINs   from   LAT
                 terminals.

                                  ----- Hints -----

             To  check  the  current  LOGINS-ALLOWED,  type  the  TOPS-20
             command INFORMATION (ABOUT) SYSTEM-STATUS.

             To disallow certain terminals, use ^ESET NO  LOGINS-ALLOWED,
             described as the next Argument to the ^ESET command.

                                 ----- Examples -----

             1.  If you previously had LOGINs  at  the  console  terminal
                 only and you also want to allow pseudo-terminal LOGINs:

                  ___________                 @ENABLE<RET>
                  _____ ______________      _____________________                 $^ESET LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) PSEUDO-TERMINALS<RET>

        NO LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal        NO LOGINS-ALLOWED (ON) terminal

             specifies to disallow LOGINs from  certain  terminals.   The
             value terminal can be:

                  ANY-TERMINAL
|                 INTERNET-TERMINALS
                  CONSOLE-TERMINAL

                  PSEUDO-TERMINALS
                  REMOTE-TERMINALS

             Thus, you can  prevent  certain  users  from  accessing  the
             system.   The  command  removes the specified terminals from
             the list of terminals from which LOGINs are allowed.

                                         NOTE

                 You cannot use this command to disallow LOGINs  from
                 LAT  terminals.   Use  the STOP command from the LCP
                 command set.  See Chapter 4 (LCP COMMANDS) for  more
                 information   about   disallowing  LOGINs  from  LAT
                 terminals.

        MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH 'n'        MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH 'n'

             specifies a minimum password length to help ensure directory
             security.    The   'n'  must  be  a  value  from  1  to  39,
             representing the minimum number of characters needed  for  a
             password  specification  to the directory.  You can find the
             current setting for the minimum  password  length  with  the
             EXEC command INFORMATION SYSTEM-STATUS.

        NO MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH        NO MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH

             specifies that the password must be at least 8 characters in
             length.    This   is   the   default   when   the   argument
             MINIMUM-PASSWORD-LENGTH  is  not  specified  in  the   ^ESET

             specifies to enable the offline structure facility  and  set
             the  timeout interval to "mm:ss", where mm is minutes and ss
             is seconds.  The default is  one  (1:00)  minute.   You  can
             specify  from one second (00:01) to fifteen minutes (15:00).
             The time you specify is the length of time  between  when  a
             disk  unit is noticed as offline by the monitor and the time
             when the monitor marks the structure as offline.

        NO OFFLINE-STRUCTURES        NO OFFLINE-STRUCTURES

             specifies to disable the offline  structure  facility.   The

             releases.

        OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE        OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE

             specifies that there is an operator present on  the  system.
             It  also  notifies  OPR/ORION  that  form  changing  can  be
             performed on the line printers.

                                 ----- Example -----

        NO OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE        NO OPERATOR-IN-ATTENDANCE

             specifies there is no operator present on the system.   (The
             INFORMATION  (ABOUT)  SYSTEM-STATUS command displays whether
             or not an operator is in attendance.) This command  prevents
             certain   system   programs,   for   example,  PLEASE,  from
             indefinitely waiting for an operator to  respond.   It  also
             notifies  OPR/ORION  to  not allow any forms changing on the
             line printers.  Be sure to give this command  if  you  leave
             the computer room temporarily or if your shift is ending and
             no operator is coming on duty.

             This is the default setting.

        TERMINAL n m SPEED (OF INPUT) r (OF OUTPUT) t        TERMINAL n m SPEED (OF INPUT) r (OF OUTPUT) t

             specifies that terminal (n), or a range of terminals  (n m),
             where  n  is  the  lowest  terminal line number and m is the
             highest, have an input speed of r and an output speed of  t;
             r is the receive baud rate; and t is the transmit baud rate.
             The legal baud rates are 0, 75, 50, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300,
             600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, and 9600.

             This command works like the user command TERMINAL SPEED, but
             it also allows you to set the speeds for any terminal on the
             system.  If you give only one  speed,  it  applies  to  both
             input and output.

        The ^ESPEAK command sends commands to SYSJOB, which is run  under
        job  0.   SYSJOB  is  a  system  task  that controls other system
        processes and jobs.  ^ESPEAK allows you to check  the  status  of
        the processes under SYSJOB and restart them, if necessary.

        The SYSJOB commands, which  you  must  use  to  communicate  with
        processes  run  under  SYSJOB,  are explained below.  For ease of
        discussion, they are not alphabetical.

             RUN filespec of program             RUN filespec of program

                  This command creates an inferior process and  runs  the
                  specified  program in it.  The process is identified by
                  a name consisting of the first six  characters  of  the
                  name portion of the file specification.

             KILL name             KILL name

                  This command kills the process of the specified name.

             PURGE process number             PURGE process number

                  This command kills the process of the specified number.
                  Process  numbers  appear  in  the  first  column of the
                  STATUS command display.  With the  PURGE  command,  you
                  can distinguish among processes having the same name.

             FREEZE name             FREEZE name

                  This command  temporarily  suspends  execution  of  the
                  specified  process (name).  This may later be undone by
                  the RESUME command.

             RESUME name             RESUME name

                  This command continues execution of the process  having
                  the  specified  name,  thus  undoing  the  effect  of a
                  previous FREEZE.

             DUMP process number             DUMP process number

                  This command allows you  to  obtain  a  snapshot  of  a
                  process'    memory   without   disturbing   operations.
                  Execution of the process is temporarily suspended;  the
                  ACs  and  memory  contents  are  saved in file xxx.DMP,
                  where xxx  is  the  process  name;  then  execution  is
                  resumed.  Refer to Example 4.


        JOB COMMANDS        JOB COMMANDS

             JOB ident text-string             JOB ident text-string

                  This command transmits text to a job via  a  PTY.   The
                  ident  is an arbitrary small integer not related to the
                  system job number of the  job  being  controlled.   You
                  should  choose  the  smallest number (beginning with 0)
                  not presently  in  use  when  a  new  job  is  desired.
                  Thereafter, that number identifies that job for SYSJOB.

                  The  text-string  is  a  string  of   system   commands
                  surrounded  by  any  character not occurring within the
                  string, for example, /a  string  of  characters/.   The
                  string   may   include   <RET>,  other  format  control
                  characters, and control characters.  You must  indicate
                  a  control character by typing an up-arrow (^) followed
                  by the character.  If you want to indicate an up-arrow,
                  when  it  is  not  being  used  to  indicate  a control
                  character, type two up-arrows.  If there is no  job  in
                  existence  when a JOB command is executed, a ^C is sent
                  ahead of the  specified  text  to  create  one.   Note,
                  however,  that  the job is not automatically logged in,
                  so a LOGIN command must be given via the JOB command.

                  Any output from the job is handled by SYSJOB and  typed
                  on  the  CTY.   Each  line  is  prefixed with the ident
                  number of the job which produced the output.  Output is
                  only  typed  at the end of a line, so prompt characters
                  coming from a job are not seen until the  remainder  of
                  the line has been input.

             KILLJOB ident             KILLJOB ident

                  This command forces a LOGOUT of the specified job.

             CCJOB ident             CCJOB ident

                  This command transmits two ^C's to  the  specified  job
                  and  holds  any  further input until the ^C's have been
                  processed.

                  existing inferior processes and jobs presently known to
                  SYSJOB.

             RELOAD             RELOAD

                  This  command  causes  SYSJOB  to  reload  and  restart
                  itself.  Use this command with great caution, as it can
                  cause an abrupt termination of all  inferior  processes
                  and  detach  any PTY-controlled jobs.  If possible, you
                  should kill all processes and log out all  jobs  before
                  the RELOAD is executed.  This command allows you to put
                  a  new  version  of  SYSJOB   into   operation   during
                  timesharing  and  provides  the possibility of recovery
                  after a severe SYSJOB malfunction.

        All text on the line following the prompt message up to CTRL/Z is
        input  to  SYSJOB.   Actually,  the text is written into the file
        SYSTEM:SYSJOB.COMMANDS.  Then, a  wakeup  request  is  issued  to
        SYSJOB  which  reads  the  file  and performs the commands in it.
        Thus, it is equivalent to:

             COPY (FROM) TTY: (TO) SYSTEM:SYSJOB.COMMANDS

        as soon as SYSJOB wakes up and reads the file.

        The text must consist of SYSJOB commands, which are described  in
        this  section  under  the Subcommands heading.  The same commands
        are  recognized  in  both  the  SYSJOB.COMMANDS  file   and   the
        SYSJOB.RUN  file,  which  SYSJOB  reads  at  system startup.  The
        commands are in the form  of  a  keyword,  possibly  followed  by
        arguments.  The commands (text) can be divided into three types:

             1.  Those affecting an inferior process:

                      RUN, KILL, FREEZE, RESUME

             2.  Those  affecting  a  job  being  controlled  by  a   PTY
                 (pseudo-terminal):

                      JOB, KILLJOB, CCJOB

        All SYSJOB output appears on the CTY.  Therefore, if you are at a
        terminal  other  than  the CTY and you want to see SYSJOB output,
        enable for OPERATOR or WHEEL capability,  TALK  to  the  terminal
        that  is  the  CTY,  give  the ^ESPEAK command followed by SYSJOB
        commands, and type BREAK after you have seen the output.

        The following  error  message  is  associated  with  the  ^ESPEAK
        command:

        ? CAN'T GET JFN ON <SYSTEM>SYSJOB.COMMANDS

             You have typed ENABLE but you do not have OPERATOR or  WHEEL
             capability.       Therefore,      you      cannot      write
             SYSTEM:SYSJOB.COMMANDS.  You should log into an account that
             has  OPERATOR  capability  (for example, OPERATOR), and then
             type ENABLE and reissue the ^ESPEAK command.

   6.1  INTRODUCTION TO PTYCON   6.1  INTRODUCTION TO PTYCON

   Your TOPS-20 operating system considers all  jobs  to  be  timesharing
   jobs;  thus,  each  job must be associated with a timesharing terminal
   (TTY).  In some situations, however, it is inconvenient to  require  a
   timesharing  terminal  to  be associated with every job on the system;
   for example, where many jobs are  needed  for  a  single  application.
   PTYCON  provides  a  method whereby a single job running from a single
   timesharing terminal can control many subjobs simultaneously.  This is
   accomplished by implementing a "device" called a pseudo-terminal (PTY)
   that, in  effect,  is  a  software  simulation  of  a  terminal.   The
   controlling  job,  PTYCON,  can  send information to a PTY and receive
   information from a PTY.

   PTYCON  starts  running  subjobs  by  means  of  pseudo-terminals  and
   controls  each subjob by sending appropriate information (for example,
   the commands and/or data you give it) over  the  PTY  controlling  the
   subjob.   You can run as many subjobs as there are PTYs on the system,
   up to a maximum of 24.  PTYCON allows you to remain  at  one  terminal
   and still control multiple jobs by means of multiple PTYs.



   6.2  STARTING PTYCON   6.2  STARTING PTYCON

   PTYCON is normally started  automatically  on  your  console  terminal
   (CTY)  by  SYSJOB when the system is brought up.  At this time, PTYCON
   reads and processes the file <SYSTEM>PTYCON.ATO (usually  referred  to
   as   an   "Auto-File").   This  file  contains  commands  for  PTYCON.
   Following is example of a <SYSTEM>PTYCON.ATO  file  that  defines  and
   starts the subjobs OPR, CHECKD, and FILCOM:

        SILENCE
        LOG
        DEFINE 0 OPR
        OPR-LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR
        DEFINE 1 CKD

        CKD-LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR
        DEFINE 2 FIL
        FIL-LOG OPERATOR FOO OPERATOR
        OPR-ENABLE

        WHAT ALL
        CONNECT OPR
          <RET>                  ;Line contains a carriage return

   This processing consists of bringing up OPR  and  any  other  programs
   that you might need such as CHECKD and FILCOM.  If PTYCON does not use
   PTYCON.ATO automatically, you can attach to PTYCON and, after you  see
   the prompt PTYCON>, type:

        ___ _______________________        GET <SYSTEM>PTYCON.ATO<RET>

   You could also follow the GET with a different file  specification  to

   If the output from SYSTAT OPERATOR showed that PTYCON was not running,
   you must start it yourself.  To do this, type PTYCON at system command
   level.  When PTYCON responds with its prompt, type the GET command  to
   run the auto file.

   It is important to look at this output when the system starts to check
   whether  the  proper programs have been started.  If you attach to the
   PTYCON job, you should also give a WHAT ALL command to PTYCON to check
   the status of these programs.

   The commands to start and control programs under  PTYCON  are  in  the
   file  SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO.   Your  System Manager must decide what those
   commands should be.  If they differ from those in the PTYCON.ATO  file
   supplied,  you  must  change the file with an editor.  The commands in
   this file can be in uppercase or lowercase.

   The PTYCON.ATO file normally runs OPR, and any other service  programs
   that your System Manager decides to run as subjobs of PTYCON.



   6.3  COMMUNICATION WITH PTYCON AND ITS SUBJOBS   6.3  COMMUNICATION WITH PTYCON AND ITS SUBJOBS

   6.3.1  Subjobs   6.3.1  Subjobs

   A subjob is a job running on a pseudo-terminal (PTY) under control  of
   PTYCON.   PTYCON allows you to start and control as many jobs as there
   are pseudo-terminals (PTYs) available on your system, but  never  more
   than 24.  To find out how many PTYs are available on your system, type
   the EXEC command INFORMATION (ABOUT) AVAILABLE DEVICES.  To  find  out
   how many PTYs are in use by PTYCON, type the PTYCON command WHAT ALL.

   Each subjob is identified by a unique number from 0 to n-1, where n is
   the  maximum number of PTYs available on your system.  For example, if
   your system can have 24 PTYs, the subjobs can be numbered  from  0  to
   23.   Each  subjob  is  assigned  a  number when you use the DEFINE or
   CONNECT command to start the subjob.

   To make it easier for you to keep track of the subjobs, you  can  also
   use  the  DEFINE  command  to give a subjob a name.  A subjob name can
   consist of up to five alphanumeric characters.  If you  type  in  more
   than  five  characters,  PTYCON  (in most cases) truncates the name to
   five characters.

   Before you try to start a subjob under PTYCON, be sure that PTYCON  is
   running.   If  it  is,  you should see the prompt PTYCON>.  To get the
   prompt, you might have to type POP or  the  PTYCON  escape  character,
   which  is  <CTRL/X>  by default.  (See the PTY commands CONNECT, PUSH,
   and REDEFINE.

   When PTYCON is running and has printed its prompt,  PTYCON>,  you  can
   communicate with it or its subjobs in the following ways:

        1.  You can type a single- or multiple-line PTYCON  command  (see
            Section   6.5  for  a  complete  description  of  all  PTYCON
            commands).

        2.  You can type a single-line  subjob  command  to  an  existing
            subjob.  A subjob command is:

                 PTYCON>n-text

            where n is the subjob name or number and text  is  a  TOPS-20
            command or input to a program running under subjob n.


                                    NOTE

                  n cannot be a subjob  name  longer  than
                  five  characters.   You must type in the
                  subjob name exactly as  shown  when  you
                  type  in  a  question  mark  (?)  at the
                  PTYCON prompt (PTYCON>).


   3.  You can give the CONNECT command to PTYCON to connect to a subjob.
       Then  you  can  communicate  directly  with  the  subjob by typing
       exactly what you would type to a job not under PTYCON.   To  later
       return  to PTYCON command level, type the PTYCON escape character,
       which is <CTRL/X> by default.

   4.  You can give the PUSH command to  PTYCON  to  perform  a  task  at
       TOPS-20  command  level.  You can type commands or run programs as
       you would under any job, but you do not have to log in a job.   To
       return to PTYCON command level, type POP.

   In communicating with a subjob, you can use all the  standard  TOPS-20
   features.    You  can  use  <CTRL/C>,  <CTRL/T>,  <CTRL/R>,  <CTRL/U>,
   recognition, rubout, DDT, EDIT, TV, languages,  and  system  commands.
   However, there are some restrictions.

        1.  You can never pass the current PTYCON escape character  to  a
            subjob,  because  it has a special purpose.  (See the CONNECT
            command.)

        2.  <CTRL/\> (control backslash) cannot be passed  to  a  job  or
            subjob  from  the  CTY,  because  it  causes you to enter the
            console processor command language  (PARSER).   If  you  type
            <CTRL/\> by mistake, immediately type QUIT.

        3.  If you are giving a single-line subjob command as:

                         _________ ____________ ______                 PTYCON> OPR-ABORT BATCH-STREAM 2<RET>

            you cannot use recognition, because the command is not passed
            to the system until you press RETURN or LINE FEED.

        4.  <CTRL/H> does not reprint a faulty command up to the point of
            error.

   6.3.2  Creating Subjobs   6.3.2  Creating Subjobs

   To create a subjob, use either the CONNECT or  DEFINE  command.   When
   you  give  either command with a number that has not yet been assigned
   to a subjob, you create a subjob with that number.  If you type ESCAPE
   in  place  of a number in the DEFINE command, you create a subjob with
   the next free subjob number.  The DEFINE command also  allows  you  to
   associate a name with the subjob.

                                    NOTE

           Whenever you create a subjob, you must then log in  to
           get  a system job number, as you do for any other job.
           If you enable your privileges,  you  can  use  a  null
           password if you log in under the same name that PTYCON
           is logged in under.

   For example, you use CONNECT to create a subjob:

                _______ ______        PTYCON> CONNECT 0<RET>
        [Connected to subjob 0]

   At this point, you can give commands directly to the  job.   When  you
   want to return to PTYCON command level, type CTRL/X.

   Once a subjob exists, you can communicate with it by:

         o  Sending commands through PTYCON

         o  Connecting directly to the subjob



   6.3.3  Communicating with Subjobs through PTYCON   6.3.3  Communicating with Subjobs through PTYCON

   You can send commands to subjobs while your terminal is at the PTYCON>
   prompt.  The format is:

        PTYCON> n-text

   where

        n         is the subjob name or number, followed by a hyphen

        text      is a TOPS-20 command or program input to be sent to the
                  subjob

                                    NOTE

              n cannot be  a  subjob  name  longer  than  five
              characters.   You  must  type in the subjob name
              exactly as shown when you  type  in  a  question
              mark (?) at the PTYCON prompt (PTYCON>).

   The subjob name is an alternate way to  specify  a  subjob.   Use  the
   DEFINE command to define a subjob name.

   When you are giving commands to a subjob, be sure  that  you  know  if
   your subjob is waiting for program input or if it is at system command
   level.  The last character output by the subjob is "@" or "$" if it is
   at  system  command  level,  and  a  program-specific  prompt if it is
   awaiting program input.  If it is awaiting program input and you  want
   to  give it a system command, first send a <CTRL/C> (followed by <RET>
   to end the command).  Then, send the desired system command.   In  the
   case  of  OPR  as  a subjob, type EXIT to the OPR> prompt (followed by
   <RET>) to get to system command level.

   PTYCON accepts single- or  multiple-line  commands  after  the  prompt
   PTYCON>.   If  the PTYCON command line is longer than the maximum line
   length allowed by your terminal, you can continue typing  the  command
   past  the  end  of  the  line and onto the next line, without pressing
   RETURN.  PTYCON accepts command components that  are  divided  between
   lines.   If  you  want  to  avoid  divided  words,  use the hyphen (-)
   continuation character.  At the end of the first line, type  a  hyphen
   and press RETURN.  Then, continue typing the command on the next line.
   At the end of the command, press RETURN to confirm the command.

   The following example sends a multiple line command to a subjob.

               ______ _______ ____ ________ __ __ __ __ __ ___ ______        PTYCON>ACCEPT (OUTPUT FROM SUBJOBS) 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, -<RET>

   To communicate with a subjob by direct  connection,  use  the  CONNECT
   command, type exactly what you want to communicate to the subjob, then
   finish with the PTYCON escape character, normally CTRL/X.

   When you connect to a subjob that has not been logged  in,  the  first
   character that you type causes the identification message to be output
   on your terminal.  For example,

           You cannot send the current PTYCON escape character to
           a subjob, because that character returns you to PTYCON
           command level if you are connected to a subjob, or  it
           aborts  the  current  command  if  you  are  at PTYCON

           with the REDEFINE command to PTYCON.



   6.3.5  Subjob Output   6.3.5  Subjob Output

   You can do the following with the output from subjobs of PTYCON.

         o  Allow it to be typed on your terminal

         o  Buffer it until you request it

         o  Save it in a file

         o  Discard it

   The PTYCON commands that control the  output  of  the  subjobs  either
   collectively or individually are:

         o  ACCEPT

         o  REFUSE

         o  LOG

         o  DISCARD

   If REFUSE is set for a subjob, its output is typed  on  your  terminal
   only  when  you are connected to the subjob.  Otherwise, the output is
   buffered until you request it with the ACCEPT (or NO  REFUSE)  command
   or  until  you connect to the subjob.  If DISCARD is set for a subjob,
   again its output is  printed  on  your  terminal  only  when  you  are
   connected  to  the subjob.  Otherwise, the output is discarded, except
   for recording it in a file if the PTYCON LOG command was given.

   If neither REFUSE nor DISCARD has been set for a subjob, the  subjob's
   output  is  printed  on your terminal.  If PTYCON is at command level,

   output from each subjob is preceded by a header containing the  subjob
   name and/or number and the time.  If you are connected to a subjob:

         o  All output from the  connected  subjob  is  printed  on  your
            terminal without headers.

         o  All other subjob output  is  printed  on  your  terminal  and
            preceded by a header containing the name and/or number of the
            subjob giving output and the time.  The output is followed by
            a  trailer containing the name and/or number of the connected
            subjob and the time.

                                        NOTE

                    If you are  at  command  level  and  you  are
                    entering   a   command,   PTYCON  temporarily
                    suspends output from the  subjobs  until  the
                    command  is  confirmed with a carriage return
                    or line feed.
   For example, you are connected to subjob 3 and output  is  typed  from
   subjob   0,   which  is  defined  as  OPR,  beginning  with  a  header
   (**** OPR(0) hh:mm:ss ****).   (Where  hh:mm:ss   is   the   time   in
   hours:minutes:seconds.)  When  the  output  from subjob 0 is done, the
   trailer is output, indicating that the currently connected subjob is 3
   (**** 3 hh:mm:ss ****).

   When you have completely finished using a subjob, you can log  it  out
   and  deassign  its  subjob  number  with  the  KILL command.  (See the
   description of the KILL command to PTYCON.

   You can log out a subjob by specifying either the subjob name  or  the
   subjob  number.   For  example,  to  log  out  subjob 0, which is also
   defined as subjob OPR:

   To leave PTYCON permanently, you should be certain that  you  have  no
   more  use  for any of the subjobs; then use KILL ALL and EXIT.  During
   timesharing, you should never do this to  the  PTYCON-controlling  OPR
   and  any other utility program (such as, DUMPER or CHECKD) because you
   might need them to service users.

   For example, you log out all subjobs and EXIT  from  PTYCON  before  a
   system shutdown for preventive maintenance:

                ____ ________        PTYCON> KILL ALL<RET>
                _________        PTYCON> EXIT<RET>
        @

   If you want to leave PTYCON temporarily  to  do  something  at  system
   command level and not use a subjob, use the PUSH command, perform your
   commands, and return to PTYCON with POP.  (See the example  under  the
   description of the PUSH command.)

   6.4.2  Using Recognition Input   6.4.2  Using Recognition Input

   PTYCON recognition input works with commands and subjob names.  To use
   recognition  input, type enough letters of a command or subjob name to
   make it unique,  and  then  type  <ESC>.   PTYCON  responds  with  the
   remainder  of  the  command  and its guidewords or the complete subjob
   name.

   PTYCON recognizes command names before subjob names.  For example,  if
   you  have  a  subjob  named LOOK and you type LO<ESC>, PTYCON responds
   with the LOG command.

                           commas.  If you defined a name for the subjob,
                           you can specify the name instead of the subjob
                           number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The ACCEPT command is the normal mode of operation.

        When  used  after  NO  ACCEPT  or  REFUSE,  the  ACCEPT   command
        immediately  types on your terminal any available output from the
        specified subjobs and continues to do so as it becomes available.
        If  you  do not specify any subjobs, ALL is automatically printed
        and assumed.

        NO ACCEPT is equivalent to REFUSE.  If you  do  not  specify  any
        subjobs, ALL is assumed.

   BELL - Sounding Bell for Output Waiting   BELL - Sounding Bell for Output Waiting



   Function   Function

        The BELL command rings your terminal bell every  ten  seconds  to
        indicate  that  a subjob has output waiting to be printed on your
        terminal.  This is referred to as a refused subjob.

        or

        PTYCON> NO BELL


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The BELL command is the normal mode of operation.

        Therefore, you need to give the BELL command only when  you  want
        to cancel a NO BELL command that you previously issued.

        When you give the PUSH command to PTYCON,  the  output  from  all
        subjobs  is  refused, unless it is already being discarded (refer
        to the DISCARD command).  The BELL command also applies to  these
        refused subjobs.

        NO BELL suppresses any bell, indicating that a refused subjob has
        some  output.   Consequently,  you  are  not warned that there is
        output waiting.


   Example   Example

        1.  You specify NO BELL to turn off the  bell  sound  for  output

   Function   Function

        The CONNECT command connects your terminal to a specified subjob,
        such  that the subjob appears to be a normal timesharing job that
        is not running under PTYCON.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> CONNECT n


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.   You  can  specify
                           any  number  from  0  to 23.  If you defined a
                           name for  the  subjob,  you  can  specify  the
                           subjob name instead of the subjob number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        After issuing the CONNECT command, all commands that you type are
        passed  directly  to  the subjob until you type the PTYCON escape
        character, which is CTRL/X by  default.   You  can  redefine  the
        escape character with the REDEFINE command to PTYCON.

        As soon as you connect to  a  subjob,  you  receive  the  message
        [Connected  to  subjob name(n)] or [Connected to subjob n].  Then
        any output that was being buffered for that subjob by the  REFUSE
        or NO ACCEPT command is printed on your terminal.

        If you do not specify a subjob,  PTYCON  connects  your  terminal
        either  to  the  last  connected  subjob  or  to  the last subjob
        defined, whichever was done most  recently.   If  you  specify  a
        valid  subjob number that you have not defined, a new subjob with
        that number is created for you.  However, you  cannot  specify  a
        subjob name that has not been defined.


   Hint   Hint

        When you are connected  to  a  subjob,  type  the  PTYCON  escape
        character,  CTRL/X by default, to return to PTYCON.  Then you see
        the PTYCON prompt.

        The DEFINE command defines a subjob.  For example, it can  create
        a new subjob, and it can associate a name with a subjob.  You can

                           You  can  specify any number from 0 to 23.  If
                           you press ESCape twice after you  type  DEFINE
                           (see  Example  1.),  the  system uses the next
                           available number.

        name               specifies an optional  name  for  the  subjob.
                           The   name   can   consist   of   up  to  five
                           alphanumeric   characters.    PTYCON    simply
                           ignores   any   characters   after  the  fifth
                           character.  If  you  use  any  nonalphanumeric
                           characters,  PTYCON  also ignores them and the
                           characters  that  follow  the  nonalphanumeric
                           characters.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If you press ESCape for the subjob number, the next  free  subjob
        number  in  the system is chosen.  This is the recommended way to
        define a new subjob.

        If you define a subjob with  a  name  already  given  to  another
        subjob, you get the message:

             % Name already in use, reassigned to this subjob

        and the name is given to the new  subjob.   Also,  defined  names
        take  precedence  over subjob numbers when you define a subjob to
        be another number.  If ALL is the name of a subjob, whenever  you
        use ALL in a PTYCON command, it refers only to that subjob.

   Function   Function

        The DISCARD command eliminates output to your terminal  from  the
        specified subjob when you are not connected to that subjob.

        PTYCON> NO DISCARD ALL


   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.  You can specify up
                           to  24  (0  -  23) subjob numbers separated by
                           commas.  If you defined a name for the subjob,
                           you can specify the subjob name instead of the
                           subjob number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The output is thrown away as far as your  terminal  is  concerned
        with  the  use  of the DISCARD command.  However, output from the
        subjob does go into the LOG file, if you  previously  issued  the
        LOG command to PTYCON.

        DISCARD differs from REFUSE, because REFUSE keeps the output  for
        acceptance  at  a  later  time.   Yet,  if you discard a subjob's
        output after you have refused it, the output buffered  by  REFUSE
        is  not  typed  on  your  terminal.   However, at the time of the
        DISCARD, any output buffered by REFUSE goes into  the  LOG  file,
        providing the LOG command to PTYCON is in effect.

        NO DISCARD is the default and allows all output to appear on your
        terminal.   However, if you issued a REFUSE for the subjob before
        the DISCARD, NO DISCARD  restores REFUSE mode for the subjob  and
        buffers the output.  (See the REFUSE command.)

   Function   Function

        The EXIT command exits from PTYCON and gets you  back  to  system
        command level.


   Format   Format

        PTYCON> EXIT


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        Use the EXIT command only when  you  want  to  permanently  leave
        PTYCON.   To  return  to  system  command level temporarily while
        subjobs are running, use the PUSH command.

        If there are subjobs active when you type EXIT, you get:

             Caution: Exiting may log out the still active subjobs!
             Confirm:  (type <CTRL/A> to get back to PTYCON)

        where "A" is the current  PTYCON  escape  character.   Type  that
        control  character to return to PTYCON immediately.  If you press
        RETURN to CONFIRM, you exit from PTYCON and you  might  lose  the
        subjobs.


   Hint   Hint

        If  you  mistakenly  type  EXIT  and  press  RETURN  to  CONFIRM,
        immediately  type  CONTINUE  to return to PTYCON and preserve any
        subjobs.

        If you first run a program or give some  command  and  then  type
        CONTINUE,  you  might not be able to get back to PTYCON.  If this
        happens, subjobs become detached and are automatically logged out
        in five minutes unless corrective measures are taken.  Therefore,
        to recover them, immediately run PTYCON again.   Then,  for  each
        subjob  that  became detached, connect to a new subjob and attach
        to a system job corresponding to a  detached  subjob.   (Use  the
        SYSTAT  command  to  see  what jobs were detached.) Note that you
        cannot refer to the former  subjob  numbers;  you  must  use  the
        system job numbers until you establish PTYCON subjobs again.

        filespec           specifies the file specification of  the  file

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        When the system is first started, SYSJOB normally  starts  PTYCON
        and  has PTYCON do a GET on SYSTEM:PTYCON.ATO.  When the commands
        in the file are processed, they are echoed on your terminal as if
        they had been typed in directly (unless SILENCE is in effect).


   Hints   Hints

        Certain characters in the command file must be typed  differently
        than  if  they  were  typed  directly  on your terminal.  Control
        characters must be typed as ^a,  where  ^  is  the  up-arrow,  or
        circumflex,  and  "a"  is the character.  Do not use the CTRL key
        for typing control characters in the command file.   ESCape  must
        be  typed  as  two  characters  ^$  (up-arrow  dollar-sign).   An
        up-arrow must be typed as ^^ (two up-arrows).

        The PTYCON command file can contain leading and  trailing  spaces
        and tabs, lowercase letters and blank lines.

        When you run PTYCON under OPERATOR (the  normal  case),  for  any
        subjob  you  log  in  under  OPERATOR,  you can give a fictitious
        password, for example, FOO in the examples below.

   Function   Function

        The KILL command kills the indicated subjobs (logs them out)  and
        deassigns  the  subjob  numbers,  provided that PTYCON is running
        with OPERATOR or WHEEL capability enabled, or  that  the  subjobs
        are logged in under the same user name as PTYCON.

        PTYCON> KILL n,...,n

   Argument   Argument

        n                  specifies a subjob number.  You can specify up
                           to  24  (0  - 23) subjobs separated by commas.
                           If you defined a name for the subjob, you  can
                           use the name instead of the subjob number.


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If the subjob is not logged in under the same user as PTYCON, the
        KILL command does not succeed, and you receive the message:

             Could not kill subjob n

        Then, you must connect to the subjob, log out, return to  PTYCON,
        and  issue  the  KILL command.  For KILL ALL you must type ALL in
        its entirety.

        The KILL command  is  necessary  to  deassign  a  subjob  number.
        Simply logging out a subjob does not deassign the subjob number.

        1.  You KILL subjob 7 which was defined as ULIST:

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        If you specify a file that already  exists,  any  new  output  is
        appended  after  the  last  entry of the existing file.  Use this
        command to keep a  record  of  what  was  typed  at  the  console
        terminal.

        NO LOG, which is the normal mode, stops output to a log file  and
        closes  the  file.  This is the only command that stops output to
        the LOG file.

        Once the LOG command is  given,  the  log  file  contains  PTYCON
        prompts,  commands, and error messages, all input to subjobs, and
        all output from subjobs.  The order of information  in  the  file
        resembles the input and output to PTYCON at your terminal.


   Hints   Hints

        If you do a DISCARD for a subjob, or GET a file that  contains  a
        SILENCE  command,  the log file contains all interactions as they
        occur, but your terminal  output  does  not.   (See  DISCARD  and
        SILENCE.)

        When you do a DISCARD for a subjob after a REFUSE, the  log  file
        gets  all  the  output  buffered by the REFUSE, and then gets all
        output from the subjob as it occurs.  However, your terminal does
        not  get  output  from  a  subjob once a DISCARD command has been
        issued.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  You specify LOG with a filename of  NOV18-79  to  record  all
            interactions with PTYCON.  The default file type is LOG.

        2.  You specify NO LOG after system startup to close the log file
            from  the  PTYCON.ATO  and then you create a new log file for
            the day's interactions with PTYCON.

        PTYCON> PUSH


   Characteristics   Characteristics

        When you give the  PUSH  command,  the  output  from  subjobs  is
        suspended.  Like REFUSE, PUSH causes a bell or beep to sound when
        output is waiting, providing the BELL command is in effect.  When
        you return to PTYCON, waiting output is printed on your terminal.

        The advantage of this command is that you  do  not  have  to  use
        another subjob or job number to do a task at system command level
        (EXEC level).  However, commands given after a PUSH  from  PTYCON
        and before a POP are not entered in the LOG file.


   Hint   Hint

        To return to PTYCON, type POP.

                                      NOTE

                Do not run PTYCON at the new EXEC command  level.
                Return   to  PTYCON  by  using  the  TOPS-20  POP
                command.


   Restriction   Restriction

        You cannot give the LOGOUT command when you have  PUSHed  out  of
        PTYCON.   If  you  do,  you  receive  the following error message
        instead of being logged out:

             ?LOG capability required
              Not logged off

        This prevents you  from  accidently  losing  your  subjobs  under
        PTYCON.

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        A bell or beep sounds every ten seconds if a refused  subjob  has
        output  waiting.   (See  the BELL command to PTYCON.) Because the
        output is buffered, you can later get the output on your terminal
        by  typing ACCEPT or NO REFUSE for the subjob or by connecting to
        the subjob.  At that time, the output is also  written  into  the
        log file, providing the PTYCON LOG command is in effect.


   Hint   Hint

        NO REFUSE, which is the normal mode, is equivalent to ACCEPT.

        file.    This  is  the  only  command  that  stops  output  to  a
        saved-input file.

        The SAVE command  records  only  the  input  to  PTYCON  subjobs.
        PTYCON  prompts,  commands, error messages, and subjob output are
        not recorded.


   Hint   Hint

        The SAVE command can be used to create a command file such  as  a
        PTYCON.ATO  or a batch control file.  Edit the file to delete the
        file  header  and  any  editing  control  characters  that   were
        recorded, such as <CTRL/U> and <CTRL/W>.

        If the file is to be executed with the PTYCON  GET  command,  use
        CONNECT commands to direct input to the proper subjobs.

        Command-recognition input  is  not  recorded  accurately  in  the
        saved-input  file.   For  example,  if  you  give  the EXEC START
        command by typing ST<ESC>, the EXEC responds with ART  (PROGRAM).
        However,  the  saved-input  file contains only the letters ST and
        the escape symbol, ^$.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  You specify SAVE with a saved-input file name of  OPR-CMD.TXT

   Characteristics   Characteristics

        The SILENCE and NO SILENCE commands are effective only when given
        in the file on which you do a GET.

        SILENCE does not stop output to a log file.

        NO SILENCE, which is the normal mode, allows all output  on  your
        terminal  while  PTYCON  processes  the  file  specified in a GET
        command.


   Hint   Hint

        If you have a SILENCE command in a file on which you intend to do
        a  GET, you should then include a NO SILENCE in the file.  If you
        do not include  the  NO  SILENCE  command,  the  SILENCE  command
        suppresses the last PTYCON prompt on your terminal.


   Examples   Examples

        1.  Your PTYCON.ATO file  might  contain  SILENCE  as  the  first
            command  to  silence  output  to  your  terminal  when SYSJOB
            executes the GET PTYCON.ATO command at system startup.
