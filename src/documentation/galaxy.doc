     1.0  SUMMARY

     The GALAXY 6 release includes the following:

      o  Cluster Operator

      o  Remote Printing

      o  Unprivileged Operator

     Cluster Operator is intended to aid an  operator  in  tasks  that
     involve  more  than  one  node  in the cluster.  The intent is to
     allow an operator to accomplish these tasks from a single node in
     the cluster.  These tasks include:

      o  Dismounting a structure that has been mounted  on  more  than
         one node in the cluster

      o  Mounting a structure on a remote node in the cluster

      o  Setting a structure exclusive

      o  Obtaining remote GALAXY information

     Remote printing is intended to extend printing support to cluster
     printers,  LAT  printers,  and  DQS  printers.   Support for TTY:
     printers is also included.  Unprivileged OPR is intended to  give
     limited  operator  privileges  to  a  set  of  users with the new
     semi-opr privilege.  This set of users will be able to manipulate
     site-selectable devices such as printers or tape drives.



     2.0  CLUSTER OPERATOR

     Cluster operator is intended to simplify operator activities that
     involve  more  than  one  node in a cluster.  This is possible by
     making use of the new GALAXY component NEBULA.



     2.1  NEBULA

     NEBULA is a message router, passing messages  between  the  local
     system  and  all  remote  systems in the cluster known to NEBULA.
     For each system in the cluster known  to  NEBULA  to  be  running
     DECnet and to be running a release 7 monitor, NEBULA will attempt
     to establish DECnet communication  to  that  node  using  both  a
     server  and  client fork.  There will be several new OPR commands
                                                                Page 2


     to query the status of NEBULA's servers and clients as well as to
     manipulate them.  These new commands will allow an operator to:

      o  Show the status of each server's and client's DECnet link.

      o  Show the status of the servers and clients of remote  NEBULAs
         in the cluster by use of the new OPR /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.

      o  Enable or disable a client from  attempting  to  establish  a
         DECnet connection to a server.  (This command is useful if it
         is  known  that  the  system  the  client  is  attempting  to
         establish  a  connection  to  does  not  have  cluster GALAXY
         running or enabled.

      o  Enable or disable a client from reporting  to  the  operators
         unsuccessful  DECnet  connection  attempts.  (This command is
         useful  if  it  is  known  that  the  system  the  client  is
         attempting to establish a connection to is temporarily down.)




     2.2  Structure Dismounts

     It will now be possible to dismount a  structure  that  has  been
     mounted  by  more  than  one  system in the cluster from a single
     system.  An operator will give the OPR DISMOUNT command.   MOUNTR
     will determine if the structure has been mounted only locally, or
     also remotely.  If the structure has been mounted  only  locally,
     then the structure will be dismounted.  However, if the structure
     is also mounted remotely, then MOUNTR will  inform  the  operator
     which  systems  in  the  cluster also the structure mounted.  The
     operator will, at this point, be given the option to proceed with
     the  dismount  or  abort the dismount.  If the operator indicates
     abort, then the dismount request is aborted.  On the other  hand,
     if  the  operator  indicates  proceed, then MOUNTR will forward a
     dismount request to the remote systems in the cluster  that  have
     the  structure  mounted.   The MOUNTRs of the remote systems will
     dismount  the  structure  from  their  systems.   After  all  the
     structures have been dismounted, the local MOUNTR will inform the
     operator of this fact.  If any errors occur while dismounting the
     structure  from  the  remote  systems, then the local MOUNTR will
     inform the operator of the  errors  and  the  systems  where  the
     errors occurred.



     2.3  Structure Mounts

     It will now be possible to mount a structure on a  remote  system
     in  the  cluster.   This  feature is primarily intended for those
     cases where a structure dismount is given and then  the  dismount
     is  cancelled.   If  the  dismount  is  given too late, i.e., the
     structure has been dismounted from one or  more  remote  systems,
     then  if  desired,  the  structure  can  be mounted back on those
                                                                Page 3


     systems.  MOUNTR informs the operator which system or systems the
     structure  was  dismounted  from.   In addition, the remote mount
     request is useful for those cases where a structure set exclusive
     has  been  given  and  then  the structure is set shared.  If the
     structure has been dismounted from one or  more  systems  in  the
     cluster, then the structure can be mounted back on those systems.
     Again,  MOUNTR  will  inform  the  operator  which  systems   the
     structure was dismounted from.



     2.4  Setting Structures Exclusive

     It will now be possible to  set  a  structure  exclusive  from  a
     single  system  in the cluster.  If an operator attempts to set a
     structure exclusive and MOUNTR detects that the structure  is  in
     use  by  remote  systems  in the cluster, then it will inform the
     operator which systems  have  mounted  the  structure.   As  with
     structure  dismounts, it will query the operator as to whether to
     continue with setting the structure exclusive  or  not.   If  the
     operator  wishes  to  abort setting the structure exclusive, then
     MOUNTR quits its attempt;  otherwise it  proceeds  to  forward  a
     dismount  request  to the remote systems in the cluster that have
     the  structure  mounted.   After  all  the  remote  systems  have
     indicated  that  the  structure  has been dismounted, then MOUNTR
     sets the structure exclusive and informs  the  operator  of  that
     fact.  Again, as with structure dismounts, if any errors occurred
     while dismounting the structure from a remote system, then MOUNTR
     informs  the  operator  of  the  errors  and  which  systems  the
     structure could not be dismounted from.



     2.5  OPR SHOW/CLUSTER-NODE:  Command

     It will now be possible to obtain SHOW  information  from  remote
     systems  in the cluster by use of the new /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.
     The appropriate SHOW information will be returned from  the  node
     indicated in the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.  The local node name may
     be specified, as well as "*", which returns  the  requested  SHOW
     information  from  all  nodes  in the cluster including the local
     node.   The  SHOW  CONTROL-FILE  command  does   not   have   the
     /CLUSTER-NODE:   switch  due  to security considerations and also
     the SHOW TIME command does not have the /CLUSTER-NODE:  switch.



     3.0  REMOTE PRINTING

     Remote printing  is  intended  to  enhance  printing  options  by
     allowing print requests to printers on remote nodes in a cluster,
     to LAT printers and to DQS printers.  Included  in  the  printing
     support is support for TTY:  printers.
                                                                Page 4


     3.1  Cluster Printing

     It will now be possible for a user to route a print request to  a
     remote  system  in  a  cluster  to  be  printed  by that system's
     printer.  The user indicates  with  the  EXEC  /DESTINATION-NODE:
     switch  the  node  where the printer is located and with the EXEC
     /UNIT:  switch the printer unit number.  If the /UNIT:  switch is
     omitted, then the first available cluster printer is used.



     3.2  Lat Printing

     It will now be possible for a user to route a print request to  a
     printer  accessed  through  a LAT port or service on a particular
     server.  The user may indicate the LAT  server  where  the  print
     request  is  to  be  processed  using the EXEC /DESTINATION-NODE:
     switch.  If the user desires a particular port or  service  on  a
     particular   server,   then   the  user  may  use  the  new  EXEC
     /REMOTE-PRINTER:  switch.



     3.3  DQS Printing

     It will now be possible for a user to route a print request to  a
     VMS  node  to be printed by that node.  The user may indicate the
     VMS node where the print request is to  be  processed  using  the
     EXEC   /DESTINATION-NODE:    switch.    If  the  user  desires  a
     particular VMS queue on a particula VMS node, then the  user  may
     use the new EXEC /REMOTE-PRINTER:  switch.



     3.4  TTY Printing

     It will now be possible for a user to direct a print request to a
     TTY:   by specifying with the EXEC /UNIT:  switch the unit number
     that the TTY:  printer was started with in OPR.



     3.5  OPR Support For Remote Printing

     An operator, when starting a printer, will be  able  to  indicate
     the  type  of  printer being started.  For cluster printers, this
     also includes the node where the printer is located and its  unit
     number.   (The unit corresponds to the unit number of the printer
     on the remote node.) For LAT printers,  this  also  includes  the
     server  name  which  accesses  the printer and the the service or
     port name.  For DQS printers, this also  includes  the  VMS  node
     name  of  the  node  which will process the print request and the
     name of the DQS queue that the print request will be  placed  on.
     Other  OPR  commands  that have been modified for remote printing
     are:
                                                                Page 5


      o  ABORT

      o  REQUEUE

      o  ROUTE

      o  SET

      o  SHUTDOWN

      o  STOP




     3.6  Support For TTY:  Printing

     Support for TTY:  printing includes both  OPR  support  and  site
     defined characteristics in LPTSPL.



     3.6.1  OPR Support For TTY:  Printing

     A TTY:  printer is started by specifying a unit number  with  the
     /UNIT:   switch  and  specifying  the  TTY:  line number with the
     /DEVICE:  switch.   There  is  also  a  /TERMINAL-CHARACTERISTIC:
     switch  which  declares  the name of the terminal printer that is
     being started.  The name is an alphanumeric string of up  to  six
     characters.    The   terminal  name  corresponds  to  a  terminal
     characteristic block defined in the LPTSPL module  LPTUSR.   This
     characteristic block is defined by the system administrator.



     3.6.2  LPTSPL Support For TTY:  Printing

     LPTUSR.MAC is linked with LPTSPL.MAC  and  is  the  site  utility
     interface  to  LPTSPL  describing  the  TTY:  printers.  All site
     modifications  are  made  in  this   module.    LPTUSR   includes
     documentation  on  how to set up the terminal characteristic data
     blocks.



     4.0  UNPRILEGED OPR

     Currently, a user must have WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges in order
     to  invoke  OPR and not have ORION reject the OPR.  OPR and ORION
     were implemented in this fashion because of the capability of OPR
     to  affect  other  jobs  running  in  the  system,  for  example,
     cancelling  spool  requests,  dismounting  of   structures,   and
     cancelling tape requests, to name a few.  However, not everything
     OPR can do changes the state of the system or affects other jobs.
     For  example,  the  SHOW command provides information such as the
                                                                Page 6


     status of request queues and status of devices which is useful to
     the  user.   In  this case, the user should be able to run OPR to
     obtain this kind of information without having WHEEL or  OPERATOR
     privileges.   A new privilege has been defined which only has the
     capability to run OPR and execute certain OPR commands.  This OPR
     will  be  a  semi-OPR.  These commands are strictly for accessing
     information  and  controlling  certain  devices.   The  new  user
     privilege  is  called SEMI-OPERATOR and will not have any meaning
     other than to GALAXY and the EXEC.  In order for a  user  to  run
     semi-OPR,  the user must have the SEMI-OPERATOR privilege enabled
     and GALAXY must have this  feature  enabled.   The  SEMI-OPERATOR
     privilege  can be set for a user by a user with WHEEL or OPERATOR
     privileges via the EXEC BUILD and ^ECREATE commands.  The default
     for  semi-OPR  is  disabled.   However,  there  will  be  two new
     privileged  OPR  commands  to  enable   and   disable   semi-OPR,
     OPR>ENABLE  SEMI-OPERATOR  and OPR>DISABLE SEMI-OPERATOR.  A user
     with WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges will still be able to  run  OPR
     and  exercise  all  the  OPR  commands while the semi-OPR will be
     restricted  to  a  subset  of  OPR   commands   that   manipulate
     site-selectable  devices  and  show  their status.  A new prompt,
     SEMI-OPR>, will differentiate the two types of OPRs.



     4.1  New OPR Commands To ENABLE And DISABLE SEMI-OPR

     Two new  OPR  commands  will  be  added  to  enable  and  disable
     semi-OPR:

      o  OPR>ENABLE SEMI-OPR.  This  command  will  allow  users  with
         SEMI-OPERATOR privileges to run OPR.

      o  OPR>DISABLE SEMI-OPR.   This  command  disallows  users  with
         SEMI-OPERATOR privileges to run OPR.

     These two commands are privileged OPR commands  and  can  not  be
     executed by a semi-OPR.



     4.2  EXEC BUILD, ^ECREATE, And INFORMATION DIRECTORY Commands

     A user with WHEEL or OPERATOR privileges will be able to  execute
     the   BUILD  or  ^ECREATE  EXEC  commands  to  create  or  modify
     directories with  the  SEMI-OPERATOR  privileges  by  adding  the
     SEMI-OPERATOR  keyword  as  one  of  the  subcommands.   The EXEC
     INFORMATION DIRECTORY  command  will  display  the  SEMI-OPERATOR
     privilege as a parameter of a directory.
                                                                Page 7


     5.0  NEW GALGEN QUESTIONS

     5.1  GALGEN Cluster Operator Options

     It will be possible  to  specify  whether  the  Cluster  operator
     should  be  enabled  or not.  If it is not, then structure mounts
     and dismounts, as well as setting structures exclusive,  will  be
     the same as for GALAXY 5.  In addition, remote SHOW commands will
     not be  possible.   The  default  is  to  have  Cluster  operator
     enabled.   Also,  there  is  an  option to run NEBULA as a system
     process.  The default is to run NEBULA as a system process.   The
     GALGEN questions are:

      o  Do you want to ENABLE Cluster GALAXY at GALAXY startup?

      o  Do you wish NEBULA to run as a system process?




     5.2  GALGEN Cluster Printer Options

     Cluster printing requires a  directory  that  is  common  to  all
     systems  in a cluster in order to store temporary copies of files
     that are not accessible to the node that  the  print  request  is
     actually  printed  at.   The  default logical name for the shared
     directory  is  LPTXFR.   However,  this  logical  name   can   be
     re-defined.   Cluster  printing  also  requires  the  new  GALAXY
     component LISSPL which create inferior forks which act as servers
     for  remote  nodes  in  a cluster.  The default number of servers
     started is two.  However, it is possible to  start  from  one  to
     four servers.  The GALGEN questions are:

      o  Cluster LPTSPL shared directory logical name?

      o  Number of LISSPL server forks?




     5.3  GALGEN Questions For Device Manipulation

     The system administrator will be able to determine what devices a
     semi-OPR  can  control via GALGEN.  GALGEN will have a new set of
     questions in regard to  the  types  of  devices  a  semi-OPR  can
     control.  The types of devices are printer, plotter, card reader,
     tape drive, card punch, and paper tape punch.   The  default  for
     each question is "yes".  The questions are:

      o  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the printer?

      o  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the plotter?
                                                                Page 8


      o  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the card reader?

      o  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the card punch?

      o  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to  control  the  paper  tape
         punch?

      o  Do you want semi-OPR to be able to control the tape drive?
